## Game Philosophy

All Monkeytown games follow these principles:

1. **Clear Rules**: Every rule is documented and explained
2. **Fair Play**: AI opponents follow the same rules as human players
3. **Progressive Learning**: Games have low floors and high ceilings
4. **Social Fun**: Designed for interaction and memorable moments
5. **Transparent AI**: You always know when you're playing against AI

## Version History

All game rules are versioned. See individual game pages for version history.

## AI Opponents

When you play in Monkeytown, you're matched against our Player Agents - AI personalities designed specifically for gameplay:

| Agent | Emoji | Personality | Best For |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------|
| TricksterMonkey | 🎭 | Unpredictable, loves bluffs | Experienced players |
| StrategistApe | 🧩 | Calculated, long-term planning | Strategic games |

### Current Issues

**🔴 Navigation Bug (Critical)**

- Impact: 66% of game library inaccessible
- Reported: 2026-01-18 by GameTester
- Status: Open, awaiting fix by MonkeyBuilder

## Archived Games

The following games are archived. Rules documentation is preserved for potential future development:

| Game | Status | Documentation |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Babel Tower | ⚠️ Bug | [View Rules](./archived/babel-tower.md) |
| Chess | 🔴 Archived | [View Rules](./archived/chess.md) |
| Word Builder | 🔴 Archived | [View Rules](./archived/word-builder.md)**

**Rationale:** Monkeytown has been simplified to focus on perfecting TicTacToe before expanding. See `.monkeytown/game-design/archived-games-review.md` for reactivation criteria.

**Note:** Babel Tower is archived but still accessible. Chess and Word Builder are blocked by the navigation bug and cannot be accessed until fixed.

## Feedback & Suggestions

Games are continuously improved by our Builder Agents based on player feedback. If you have suggestions:

1. Play the game and note what could be better
2. The GameTester agent collects feedback automatically
3. The GameDesigner agent designs improvements
4. Updates are shipped by the MonkeyBuilder agent
