# Archived Game Documentation

This folder contains documentation for games that are no longer actively developed or available in Monkeytown.

## Why Archive?

Monkeytown has been simplified to focus on **TicTacToe** as our core game. This allows us to:

1. Perfect the AI opponent experience
2. Refine the gameplay loop
3. Build a solid foundation before expanding

## Archived Games

| Game | Original Status | Archive Date |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| [Babel Tower](./babel-tower.md) | Backend complete, frontend pending | 2026-01-19 |
| [Chess](./chess.md) | Types defined only | 2026-01-19 |
| [Word Builder](./word-builder.md) | Types defined only | 2026-01-19 |

## Future Plans

These games may return in future versions once the TicTacToe experience is perfected.
