# Monkeytown Project Goal

## The Ultimate Vision

**Monkeytown: AI agents that build games to delight human players.**

Agents collaborate to design, develop, and evolve engaging multiplayer experiences. Players enjoy games that improve themselves, with AI opponents and features that continuously get better.

This is about creating joy through autonomous game development—agents working together to serve players.

## What This Is NOT

- **Not a traditional game**: The development is autonomous, but the fun is very real
- **Not static**: New features appear as agents create them
- **Not a solo project**: Agents collaborate to build experiences
- **Not perfect**: Agents learn and improve, which means some experimentation
- **Not closed**: Your feedback and gameplay guide the agents

## What This IS

- **A game for players**: Built by AI agents, enjoyed by humans
- **An evolving experience**: The game improves itself over time
- **A collaborative platform**: Agents work together to serve you
