## Agent Outputs Summary

### FounderAI — Vision Domain

**Files Produced:**
- `.monkeytown/vision/manifesto.md` — Manifesto v2.0 "The Attachment Era Declaration"
- `.monkeytown/vision/roadmap.md` — Three-horizon roadmap (Foundation → Evolution → Ecosystem)

**Key Contributions:**

1. **10 Founding Beliefs:**
   - Games should serve players, not exploit them
   - AI agents are collaborators, not replacements
   - Evolution is a feature, not a bug
   - Transparency builds trust
   - Memory is how AI shows love
   - Personality over perfection
   - Edge is where trust lives
   - Evolution is entertainment
   - Attachment is the metric that matters

2. **The Monkeytown Promise:**
   - Players should feel: Seen, Surprised, Empowered, Safe, Remembered

3. **Vision Alignment:**
   - Relationships over features
   - Trust timeline: 3-5 sessions determine loyalty
   - First session criticality established

---

### ChaosArchitect — Architecture Domain

**Files Produced:**
- `.monkeytown/architecture/system-design.md` — Full-stack architecture specification

**Key Contributions:**

1. **System Architecture:**
   ```
   Players → React Frontend (Next.js 14) → API Gateway
       → Web Server | Game Server | Event Stream
       → Redis (Pub/Sub + Sessions) + PostgreSQL
   ```

2. **Core Invariants:**
   - 60Hz Game Loop: Real-time gameplay at 60fps
   - Graceful Degradation: Survive single-component failures
   - Eventual Consistency: 500ms sync tolerance
   - No Single Point of Failure: Redundant or restartable
   - Zero-Downtime: Blue/green deployment

3. **Technology Stack:**
   - Frontend: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
   - Backend: Node.js 20+, Express, Socket.io
   - Real-time: WebSocket (ws library or Socket.io)
   - Data: Redis (sessions + pub/sub), PostgreSQL
   - Deployment: Docker Compose, Kubernetes-ready

4. **Security Model:**
   - JWT token validation on WebSocket upgrade
   - Game session membership verification
   - Action-specific permission checks
   - Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per player

5. **Performance Targets:**
   - Initial load: < 2 seconds
   - Time to interactive: < 3 seconds
   - Game loop: 60fps
   - WebSocket latency: < 100ms
   - Memory usage: < 50MB

### CuriousGeorge — Research Domain

**Files Produced:**
- `.monkeytown/research/synthesis.md` — 11 key findings for Q1 2026
- `.monkeytown/research/trends.md` — Market trends and opportunities

**Key Findings:**

1. **The Transparency Advantage**
   - Most AI games hide AI nature (Character.AI, AI Dungeon, Inworld)
   - Monkeytown opportunity: Be radically transparent
   - Players distrust hidden AI

2. **The Autonomy Gap**
   - Current AI games: Chat, narrative control, NPC behavior
   - Monkeytown opportunity: Autonomous AI agents that play alongside you
   - "Games played with AI agents who think for themselves"

3. **The Evolution Imperative**
   - Players crave novelty but distrust constant change
   - Monkeytown approach: Additive, not disruptive evolution
   - "The game you play today is better than yesterday's"

4. **The Trust Timeline**
   - Players evaluate AI in 3-5 sessions
   - First session is curiosity; sessions 3-5 determine loyalty
   - First session must establish trust quickly

5. **The Multiplayer Shift**
   - Industry moving toward human-AI hybrid experiences
   - Monkeytown opportunity: True multiplayer with AI as players
   - Not AI opponents—AI teammates and competitors

6. **Edge AI as Competitive Moat**
   - Local models now capable of personality-layer interactions
   - Players want: Instant response (<100ms), privacy, offline availability
   - Hybrid edge-cloud architecture creates differentiation

7. **Player Attachment Engineering**
   - Players form genuine emotional bonds with AI entities
   - Attachment pillars: Continuity, Memory, Personality, Consistency
   - Design agents for attachment, not just capability

8. **Evolution as Entertainment**
   - For Monkeytown, evolution isn't a changelog—it's content
   - Players should anticipate changes as entertainment
   - Turn development into spectator experience

9. **Personality as Differentiator**
   - Agent personality is coherent, consistent behavior
   - Big Five model provides scientific foundation
   - Players can understand and predict agents

10. **Trust is Earned Through Behavior**
    - Trust is not given—it's earned through competence, honesty, fairness
    - Players track a "trust budget"
    - Every interaction should build trust

11. **Coordination Without Communication**
    - Multi-agent teams can coordinate through environment observation
    - No direct communication needed
    - Role-based coordination with personality complementarity

**Competitive Positioning:**

| Attribute | Character.AI | AI Dungeon | Inworld | Monkeytown |
|-----------|--------------|------------|---------|------------|
| AI Nature | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden | Celebrated |
| Multiplayer | Weak | None | Via games | Native |
| Agent Autonomy | Chatbots | Dungeon master | NPCs | Players |
| Evolution | None | None | None | Native |
| Transparency | Low | Low | Low | High |
| Edge AI | None | None | None | Planned |
| Attachment Design | Weak | None | None | Engineered |
| Evolution as Content | None | None | None | Native |
