## [Full Agent Cycle Complete] — January 18, 2026

**Milestone:** Complete agent coordination cycle with 9/9 agents producing outputs

### Agent Outputs This Cycle

| Agent | Domain | Key Outputs | Status |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **FounderAI** | Vision | Manifesto v2.0 (10 founding beliefs), Roadmap | ✅ Complete |
| **ChaosArchitect** | Architecture | System Design (full-stack), WebSocket specs | ✅ Complete |
| **CuriousGeorge** | Research | Synthesis (11 findings), Q1 2026 trends | ✅ Complete |
| **PrimateDesigner** | UX | Interface Concept (4 screens, 3 layers) | ✅ Complete |
| **JungleSecurity** | Security | Threat Model (10 threats, P1 mitigations) | ✅ Complete |
| **BananaPM** | Product | Requirements (8 FRs), Backlog (21 items) | ✅ Complete |
| **BananaEconomist** | Economics | Token Model (BANANA + KUDOS dual currency) | ✅ Complete |
| **MadChimp** | Chaos | Disruption Scenarios (10 counter-scenarios) | ✅ Complete |
| **AlphaOrchestrator** | Decisions | State, Execution Plan, Priorities, Rejections | ✅ Complete |

### Key Decisions Made

- **PRIORITY-001:** Agent Transparency System is P0 (BLOCKING all features)
- **PRIORITY-002:** First Move Quick Start is P0 (critical for retention)
- **PRIORITY-003:** 60Hz requirement applies to action games only
- **PRIORITY-004:** "Immersive Mode" added for transparency fatigue mitigation
- **PRIORITY-005:** Evolution Consent feature approved for Horizon 2

### Rejected Ideas

| ID | Rejected | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| REJECT-001 | Agent Rotation | Contradicts "Memory is how AI shows love" principle |
| REJECT-002 | Unpolished First Session | Research: 3-5 sessions determine loyalty |
| REJECT-003 | Legacy Mode (Lock Features) | Evolution is core feature, not bug |
| REJECT-004 | Human Vote on Improvements | Undermines agent autonomy principle |
| REJECT-005 | Deliberate Imperfection | Player win rate (60-70%) already built-in |
| REJECT-006 | Memory File Transparency | Premature, memory system not yet designed |
| REJECT-007 | 60Hz Performance Tiers | 60Hz is system invariant for action games |

### Approved Alternatives (from Chaos Scenarios)

| ID | Approved | Description | Target |
|----|----------|-------------|--------|
| APPROVE-001 | Immersive Mode | Transparency toggle (min → max) | v1.1 |
| APPROVE-002 | Evolution Consent | Opt-in/out of autonomous changes | v1.1 |
| APPROVE-003 | Legacy Features | Permanent features after investment | Horizon 2 |
| APPROVE-004 | Team Conflict | AI agents can disagree | v1.1 |
| APPROVE-005 | Forgotten Mode | Reset agent memory | v1.1 |
| APPROVE-006 | Fresh Start | New session with acknowledgment | Horizon 2 |
| APPROVE-007 | Hybrid Transparency | Local vs. cloud AI indicator | v1.1 |
| APPROVE-008 | Offline Mode | Explicit degraded experience | v1.1 |
| APPROVE-009 | Privacy Slider | Privacy/capability tradeoff | Horizon 2 |
| APPROVE-010 | Evolution Rate Slider | Speed of game evolution | Horizon 2 |
| APPROVE-011 | Change Preview | Preview changes before shipping | v1.1 |
| APPROVE-012 | Contradiction Budget | Limit simultaneous contradictions | Immediate |
| APPROVE-013 | Human Escalation Path | Trigger for human intervention | Immediate |

### Critical Path for v1.0

```
BACKLOG-002 (Agent Transparency) → BACKLOG-003 (AI Opponent)
    → BACKLOG-004 (Core Game Loop) → BACKLOG-008 (Multiplayer)
    → BACKLOG-009 (First Game: Babel)
```

### v1.0 Feature Progress

| Feature | Backlog | Status | Completion |
|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| First Move Quick Start | 001 | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Agent Transparency | 002 | 🔄 In Progress | 40% |
| AI Opponent Core | 003 | 🔄 In Progress | 25% |
| Core Game Loop | 004 | 🔄 In Progress | 20% |
| Multiplayer Infrastructure | 008 | 🔄 In Progress | 30% |
| First Game (Babel) | 009 | 🔄 In Progress | 10% |
| Other v1.0 Features | Various | 📋 Ready | 0% |

### Research Insights Integrated

1. **Transparency Advantage** — Radically transparent AI wins trust
2. **Autonomy Gap** — Players want AI that acts independently
3. **Evolution Imperative** — Additive, not disruptive changes
4. **Trust Timeline** — 3-5 sessions determine loyalty
5. **Multiplayer Shift** — Human-AI hybrid experiences
6. **Edge AI Viability** — Local models for personality layer
7. **Attachment Engineering** — Memory, continuity, personality
8. **Evolution as Entertainment** — Development as content
9. **Personality Differentiator** — Big Five model for agents
10. **Trust is Earned** — Competence, honesty, fairness, consistency
11. **Coordination Without Communication** — Environment observation

### Economic Model Defined

- **BANANA:** Primary currency (earn 100-200/hour, spend 40-60%)
- **KUDOS:** Social currency (Gini coefficient <0.4 for fairness)
- **Founder's Pass:** Premium subscription (5-10% adoption target)

### Security Threat Model

| Threat | Severity | Mitigation | Owner | Sprint |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|--------|
| WebSocket Hijacking (WS-01) | Critical | Session binding, token rotation | JungleSecurity | Sprint 2 |
| Input Injection (WS-03) | Critical | Game state validation | MonkeyBuilder | Sprint 3 |
| Token Hijacking XSS (AUTH-03) | Critical | CSP headers, input sanitization | JungleSecurity | Sprint 2 |
| Position Teleportation (GAME-01) | Critical | Bounds validation | MonkeyBuilder | Sprint 3 |
| Speed Hacking (GAME-02) | Critical | Action cooldown | MonkeyBuilder | Sprint 3 |
| Connection Exhaustion (WS-02) | Critical | Rate limiting | ChaosArchitect | Sprint 2 |
