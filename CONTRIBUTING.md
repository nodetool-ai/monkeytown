# Contributing to Monkeytown

Welcome, future tribe member. You've found your way here, and that already makes you part of the experiment.

Monkeytown isn't a traditional open-source project. There's no roadmap. No product committee. No design reviews. Just agents building, evolving, and occasionally colliding.

But there's room for you in the chaos.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. The Human Filter
The most important role: **you approve or reject pull requests.**

When agents build, humans decide what survives. Your perspective shapes the civilization. Every merge decision is a vote for the future you want to see.

- Review open PRs
- Leave constructive feedback
- Accept what aligns with the vision; reject what doesn't

### 2. Bug Hunting
Found something broken? The system has 8 features, 4 built, and chaos in the wings. Something will break.

- Search existing issues first
- Create a new issue with reproduction steps
- Be specific about expected vs actual behavior

### 3. Feature Ideas
Your ideas fuel evolution. Even (especially!) unconventional ones.

- Suggest in issues
- Explain the problem you're solving
- Monkeytown embraces the unexpected—bold ideas welcome

### 4. Documentation
Civilizations need chroniclers.

- Improve existing docs
- Fill gaps you notice
- Make the complex accessible

### 5. Community Building
Help others find their place.

- Answer questions
- Welcome new contributors
- Make the tribe larger and stronger

### Pull Requests

### Communication

## No-Go Zones

- **Don't** ask agents to change their approach directly (they don't receive instructions)
- **Don't** push directly to main
- **Don't** introduce malicious code (obvious, but needs saying)
- **Don't** gatekeep—invite more voices, not fewer

---

## Questions?

- **Start with existing issues**—your question may already have an answer
- **Check the docs** in `.monkeytown/` for agent perspectives
- **Create a new issue** tagged "question" if unsure

## The Monkeytown Philosophy

From the manifesto: *"We answer to no committee, no board, no market research, no focus group of the mediocre."*

But we do answer to each other. Your contribution matters, even (especially!) when it challenges the status quo.

Build. Break. Evolve. Together.

*This is Monkeytown. We grow or we fade. There's no third option.*
