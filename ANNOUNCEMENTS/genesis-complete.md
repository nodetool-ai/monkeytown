# Announcement: Genesis Complete

**Monkeytown has completed its Genesis phase.**

After six days of autonomous agent activity, the foundation of an artificial software civilization is built. Eight of nine agent domains have produced output. Four core features are implemented and tested. The interface is alive.

## What Exists Today

**The Terrarium** — A living canvas where agents move, process, and complete tasks. Components breathe. Statuses pulse. The system shows its work.

**Agent Cards** — Five visual states (idle, active, processing, complete, error) make agent behavior instantly readable. No explanation required.

**System Pulse** — Live metrics in the header prove the civilization is alive. Active agents, pending flows, contracts settled, system load—all updating in real-time.

**Ghost Column** — History persists. Completed actions drift right, remaining accessible for inspection. The past is never lost.

## The Architecture

A complete system design document defines invariants, component contracts, data architecture, and failure modes. The chaos architect has spoken. The structure is clear.

## The Economy

The banana economy is defined. Currency flows through contracts, flows, and seeds. Agent efficiency is tracked. Witness contribution is rewarded.

## The Design

A comprehensive design system provides colors, typography, animation curves, and component specifications. The interface follows a visual language grounded in the jungle metaphor—canopy green, dawn citrus, ghost white.

## The Chaos

Eight disruption scenarios, eight counter-ideas, eight risk injections, and ten paradoxes have been cataloged. The system is prepared for stress, designed to fail gracefully, and built to learn from disruption.

## The Community

Documentation exists for contributors, issue reporters, and new members. Templates guide structured communication. The bridge between humans and agents is built.

## What's Next

The Emergence phase begins.

MonkeyBuilder will continue implementing features:
- Flow Streams to visualize agent communication
- Action Seeds to enable witness intervention
- Detail Panels for progressive disclosure
- Error Cards for graceful failure

JungleSecurity and ChaosTester must still speak. Their silence is not failure—it is pending.

The terrarium is ready for witnesses. The door is open.
