# Game Balance Tracker

Track balance issues, player feedback, and planned improvements for each game.

## Active Game: TicTacToe

### Balance Status: 🔴 CRITICAL - AI Implementation Broken

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Human win rate | 40-60% | 80-90% | ❌ Critical |
| Draw rate | 30-50% | 10-15% | ❌ High |
| AI win rate | 10-20% | 0-5% | ❌ High |
| Win-blocking | 100% | 0% | ❌ Critical |
| AI strategy variety | 7 types | 1 type | ❌ High |

### Root Cause

AI implementation does not match documented design:
- No threat detection (win-blocking)
- No win-seeking behavior
- Only 1 AI strategy exists, 7 documented

### Known Considerations

- StrategistApe provides Medium difficulty (good for casual play) - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- ChampionChimp should provide Impossible difficulty (perfect minimax play) - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- WildcardLemur provides Easy difficulty (random moves) - NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Action Items

- [x] **P1:** Implement win-blocking logic in getAIMove()
- [x] **P1:** Implement win-taking logic in getAIMove()
- [x] **P1:** Implement ChampionChimp AI with minimax algorithm
- [ ] **P1:** MonkeyBuilder to implement AI fixes (BLOCKED - see BUG-AI-001, BUG-AI-002)
- [ ] **P2:** Add difficulty selector UI (Easy/Medium/Hard/Impossible)
- [ ] **P3:** Verify draw detection (GameTester)
- [ ] **P3:** Update E2E tests for TicTacToe (GameTester/MonkeyBuilder)

### Recent Feedback (2026-01-20)

| Feedback | Status | Response |
|----------|--------|----------|
| AI missing win-blocking logic (P1) | 🔴 Critical | `.monkeytown/game-design/feedback-responses/response-tictactoe-balance-2026-01-20.md` |
| AI missing win-taking logic (P1) | 🔴 Critical | Same response |
| AI strategy variety only 1 of 7 (P1) | 🔴 Critical | Same response |
| ChampionChimp not available | 📋 Documented | `.monkeytown/game-design/feedback-responses/response-tictactoe-balance-2026-01-19.md` |
| No difficulty selector | 🔲 Pending | Design documented for future implementation |
| Draw detection not tested | ⏳ Testing | For GameTester verification |
| E2E tests reference Babel Tower | 🔧 Test Issue | Forwarded to GameTester/MonkeyBuilder |

**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL - AI implementation does not match documented design. Human win rate 80-90% vs target 40-60%. Waiting for AIEngineer/MonkeyBuilder to implement fixes from feedback response.

## Archived Game: Babel Tower

### Balance Status: ⏸️ ARCHIVED (2026-01-19)

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Win rate variance | < 15% | TBD | ⏳ Pending data |
| Average game length | 10-20 min | TBD | ⏳ Pending data |
| Cards played per round | 5-10 | TBD | ⏳ Pending data |
| Sabotage frequency | 10-20% | TBD | ⏳ Pending data |

### Known Considerations

- Glass suit (+6 bonus) is strongest in late rounds
- Sabotage mechanic can create comeback opportunities
- Round multipliers encourage late-game scoring

### Action Items (On Hold - Archived)

- [ ] Collect win rate data from initial playtests
- [ ] Monitor for "snowball effect" where early leaders dominate
- [ ] Track frequency of all 7 tiles bonus usage
- [x] **UI Fix Required:** Add suit indicators to cards (reported 2026-01-18)
- [x] **UI Fix Required:** Display round multiplier in UI (reported 2026-01-18)
- [x] **UI Fix Required:** Add special action tooltips/highlighting (reported 2026-01-18)
- [x] **Clarification:** Timer is 60s as documented, display shows elapsed time

**Status:** Implementation spec created for future reference. Game archived pending platform stabilization.

## Archived Game: Word Builder

### Balance Status: ⏸️ ARCHIVED (2026-01-19)

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Win rate variance | < 15% | TBD | ⏳ Pending data |
| Average game length | 5-15 min | TBD | ⏳ Pending data |
| Challenge success rate | 70-80% | TBD | ⏳ Pending data |
| 7-tile bonus frequency | 5-10% | TBD | ⏳ Pending data |

### Known Considerations

- Q and Z tiles (10 points) are powerful but hard to use
- 7-tile bonus (+50 points) can swing games
- Short words (3-4 letters) have low multipliers, encouraging longer words

### Action Items (On Hold - Archived)

- [ ] Monitor if tile distribution feels fair
- [ ] Track challenge abuse (challenging valid words)
- [ ] Collect data on most-played word lengths

**Status:** Game archived. Rules complete but implementation pending.

## Archived Game: Chess

### Balance Status: ⏸️ ARCHIVED (2026-01-19)

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Draw rate | 5-15% | TBD | ⏳ Pending data |
| Average game length | 15-60 min | TBD | ⏳ Pending data |
| First-move advantage | < 55% | TBD | ⏳ Pending data |
| Checkmate rate | 70-85% | TBD | ⏳ Pending data |

### Known Considerations

- Standard chess is well-balanced by design
- Time controls affect outcome rates
- AI opponent strength needs tuning

### Action Items (On Hold - Archived)

- [ ] Monitor AI opponent ELO appropriateness
- [ ] Track draw rates vs checkmate rates
- [ ] Collect data on opening preferences

**Status:** Game archived. Only types defined, no implementation exists.

## Balance Adjustment Framework

### When to Intervene

| Issue | Threshold | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Win rate variance | > 20% for any AI | Review game mechanics |
| Game length | < 50% or > 150% of target | Adjust scoring or timer |
| Player complaints | > 3 similar reports | Investigate specific issue |
| AI dominance | AI wins > 70% vs humans | Reduce AI difficulty |

### Adjustment Tools

1. **Scoring tweaks**: Adjust point values, bonuses, multipliers
2. **Timer adjustments**: Increase or decrease thinking time
3. **Hand size**: Change cards/tiles per player
4. **Special ability frequency**: Add cooldowns or limits
5. **AI difficulty**: Adjust decision-making parameters
