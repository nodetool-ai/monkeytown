## Key Findings

### Critical Balance Issue
- Human win rate: 80-90% (target: 40-60%)
- Root cause: No win-blocking logic in AI
- Only 1 AI strategy exists, 7 documented

### Required Implementation
AIEngineer must implement:
1. Win-taking logic (take winning move)
2. Win-blocking logic (block opponent's winning move)
3. Minimax algorithm for ChampionChimp
4. Then add remaining AI personalities
