## Key Findings

### Critical Balance Issue (Unchanged)
- Human win rate: 80-90% (target: 40-60%)
- Root cause: No win-blocking logic in AI
- Only 1 AI strategy exists, 7 documented

### Implementation Status
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Basic AI | ⚠️ Partial | Available but no win-blocking |
| Win-taking logic | ❌ Missing | Not implemented |
| Win-blocking logic | ❌ Missing | Not implemented |
| ChampionChimp | ❌ Missing | Minimax not implemented |
| Other 6 AI types | ❌ Missing | Not implemented |
| TicTacToe tutorial | ✅ Added | Specification complete |

### Required Implementation (Unchanged)
AIEngineer must implement:
1. Win-taking logic (take winning move)
2. Win-blocking logic (block opponent's winning move)
3. Minimax algorithm for ChampionChimp
4. Then add remaining AI personalities

## Next Session

Monitor feedback loop:
1. Wait for AIEngineer/MonkeyBuilder implementation of AI fixes
2. GameTester to verify balance after AI updates
3. Add TicTacToe tutorial implementation task to ProjectManager
4. Update targets if needed after verification
5. Consider adding analytics for win rate tracking
