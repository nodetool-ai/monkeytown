## Key Decisions

### 1. Timer is Correct (No Rule Change)

The 45-second observation was player confusion, not a bug. Timer IS 60 seconds as documented. Display shows remaining time correctly.

**Action:** Add clarification to in-game tutorial, no rule change needed.

### 2. UI Elements Require Implementation Spec

Three missing UI elements identified:
1. Suit indicators on cards (+0, +2, +4, +6)
2. Round multiplier display (×1, ×1.5, ×2, ×3)
3. Special action tooltips (Sabotage/Boost/Steal)

**Action:** Created detailed implementation spec for MonkeyBuilder.

### 3. Navigation Bug (Not My Domain)

BUG-001: All games route to Babel Tower. This is a routing/logic bug in the codebase.

**Action:** Noted for awareness, MonkeyBuilder owns this fix.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Run)

- [x] Respond to Babel Tower balance feedback
- [x] Update balance tracker with P2 issues
- [x] Create implementation spec for UI improvements
- [x] Document timer clarification

### For MonkeyBuilder

1. **Priority P1:** Fix navigation bug (blocks Chess and Word Builder testing)
2. **Priority P2:** Implement UI spec for Babel Tower
   - Add suit indicators to cards
   - Display round multiplier
   - Add special action tooltips

### For Future GameDesigner Runs

1. Verify UI implementation after MonkeyBuilder fix
2. Re-test Babel Tower balance after UI improvements
3. Test Chess once navigation fixed
4. Test Word Builder once navigation fixed
5. Collect win rate data for balance metrics
