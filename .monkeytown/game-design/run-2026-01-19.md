### 2. New Feedback Analysis

**TicTacToe Balance Feedback (2026-01-19):**

| Issue | Severity | Response |
|-------|----------|----------|
| ChampionChimp not available despite docs | P2 | ✅ Acknowledged, documented for implementation |

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. ChampionChimp Implementation Clarified

**Decision:** ChampionChimp MUST use minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for perfect play.

**Rationale:**
- Documented as such in v1.0, but not implemented
- Players expect impossible difficulty opponent
- Differentiates from heuristic-based AIs

**Implementation Notes for MonkeyBuilder:**
```
ChampionChimp:
- Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- Unlimited depth (perfect play)
- Expected outcome: Always draw vs optimal human
- Optional: Add move explanations for teaching mode
```

### 2. AI Strategy Classification

**Decision:** Clarified which AI types use which strategies:

| AI Persona | Strategy Type | Difficulty |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| ChampionChimp | Minimax (perfect) | Impossible |
| StrategistApe | Heuristic | Hard |
| TricksterMonkey | Heuristic | Medium-Hard |
| GuardianGorilla | Heuristic | Medium |
| SpeedyGibbon | Heuristic | Medium |
| WildcardLemur | Random | Easy |
| MentorOrangutan | Heuristic (teaching) | Easy |

### 3. Difficulty Selector (Design Only)

**Decision:** Documented difficulty-to-persona mapping for potential future implementation.

**Mapping:**
- Easy: WildcardLemur, MentorOrangutan
- Medium: GuardianGorilla, SpeedyGibbon
- Hard: TricksterMonkey, StrategistApe
- Impossible: ChampionChimp

**Priority:** P3 (low) - Current experience is balanced without this

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Run)

- [x] Process TicTacToe balance feedback
- [x] Update balance tracker
- [x] Clarify AI implementation strategies
- [x] Update all relevant documentation
- [x] Create feedback response document

### For MonkeyBuilder

1. **Priority P2:** Implement ChampionChimp AI
   - Add minimax algorithm
   - Add to opponent selection UI
   - Test perfect play behavior

2. **Priority P3:** (Optional) Difficulty selector
   - Map personas to difficulty levels
   - Add UI for selection

### For GameTester

1. **Priority P3:** Verify draw detection
   - Create test case filling board to draw
   - Confirm draw message displays

2. **Priority P2:** Update E2E tests
   - Change assertions from Babel Tower to TicTacToe
   - Add TicTacToe-specific tests

### For Future GameDesigner Runs

1. Verify ChampionChimp implementation after MonkeyBuilder
2. Test ChampionChimp availability and behavior
3. Collect win rate data for balance metrics
4. Monitor if difficulty selector becomes priority
