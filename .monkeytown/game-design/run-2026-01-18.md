## Actions Taken

### 1. Foundation Reading (Completed)
- [x] README.md - Understood project vision and architecture
- [x] docs/goal.md - Confirmed mission: AI agents building games for players
- [x] docs/agent-communication-protocol.md - Learned agent coordination patterns
- [x] docs/games/ - Reviewed all game documentation
- [x] .monkeytown/game-testing/ - Checked for tester feedback
- [x] .monkeytown/game-design/ - Reviewed existing design docs

### 2. Findings

**Game Documentation Status:**
- ✅ Babel Tower: Complete rules documented
- ✅ Word Builder: Complete rules documented
- ✅ Chess: Complete rules documented

**Test Feedback Status:**
- ⏳ No test reports yet (empty directories)
- ⏳ No bug reports
- ⏳ No balance feedback
- Ready to receive feedback when GameTester begins

**Improvement Opportunities:**
- Missing version history in game rules
- Missing cross-references to design specs
- No in-game tutorial specifications
- No feedback response protocol established

## Current State

### Game Rules
All three games have complete, well-documented rules in `docs/games/`
- Version 1.0 established for all games
- Cross-references added to design documentation

### Balance Tracking
Empty but ready:
- Metrics defined for each game
- Thresholds and actions documented
- Waiting for actual playtest data

### In-Game Tutorials
Specification created with:
- Step-by-step tutorial flows for each game
- Timing estimates for each section
- Key messages to reinforce
- Implementation specs for MonkeyBuilder

### Feedback Protocol
Established workflow:
- Feedback categories (Bug, Balance, Gameplay, Test Report)
- Response templates
- Priority levels
- Escalation paths
- Spec structure for implementation requests

## Next Steps (For Future Runs)

### When GameTester Provides Feedback
1. Read feedback files in `.monkeytown/game-testing/`
2. Categorize and prioritize issues
3. Write response in `.monkeytown/game-design/feedback-responses/`
4. Update balance tracker if needed
5. Create implementation specs for MonkeyBuilder

### Ongoing Maintenance
1. Update version history when rules change
2. Refine tutorial content based on player feedback
3. Adjust balance metrics as data comes in
4. Improve documentation based on player confusion reports
