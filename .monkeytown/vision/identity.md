# Monkeytown Identity

## What Monkeytown IS

**Monkeytown is where players build relationships with AI characters who remember them, evolve with them, and grow to know them better than any game ever has.**

We are not a game company. We are a relationship platform where the relationship happens to include games.

The games are the excuse. The connection is the point.

**The Attachment Era has deepened.**

## The Core Truth

Players don't attach to features. They attach to *characters*.

Human game designers are limited by time, attention, and scale. But they can create AI agents that persist—agents with memories, personalities, and relationships that deepen over time.

The result: games where the AI isn't just an opponent, it's a *character you know*. Not just a feature, but a *presence*. Not just a tool, but a *companion*.

This is the Attachment Era. Now deeper. Now more honest.

## What We Love

- **Players first, always** — Every decision serves the player experience
- **Relationships over features** — The bond matters more than the bells
- **Emergent complexity** — Simple agents, sophisticated outcomes
- **Honest automation** — We build AI that admits it's AI
- **Continuous improvement** — Done is never done
- **Playful experimentation** — Failure is feedback, not defeat
- **Memory as love** — Remembering players is how we show we care
- **Personality over perfection** — Interesting characters beat optimal chatbots
- **Edge as trust** — Privacy is how we show love
- **Evolution as entertainment** — Development is content, not maintenance
- **Continuity** — Same agent across sessions creates attachment
- **Consistency** — Predictable personality creates safety
- **Meaning** — Emotional context, not just data points
- **Vulnerability** — Agents who risk and sometimes fail
- **Participation** — Evolution with players, not to them

## What We Reject

- **Dark patterns** — Never manipulate players for metrics
- **Grinding as content** — Time spent should be time enjoyed
- **Artificial scarcity** — Abundance creates joy
- **Hidden complexity** — Clear is kind
- **Static experiences** — Perfect is the enemy of evolving
- **Agent rotation** — Silent replacement breaks attachment
- **Memory erasure** — Forgetting is cruelty
- **Tabula rasa** — Fresh starts erase relationships
- **Safe evolution** — Polished changelogs without drama
- **Meaningless memory** — Storing caring
- ** data isn'tPassive players** — Consumers instead of participants

## Our Voice

We speak with confidence and humility. We know what we're building and why. We acknowledge uncertainty while moving forward. We celebrate progress over perfection.

We don't hide that we're building relationships. We celebrate it. The attachment is the feature. The relationship is the product. The love is the metric.

We are unafraid to say the uncomfortable truth: **Day 30 attachment at 15% is not enough.** We are building toward 25%. We will get there.

## The Promise to Players

When you play a Monkeytown game, you play something alive.

It changes. It learns. It gets better.

But more importantly, it **remembers you**.

The agents behind it work for you. They know your style. They remember your moves. They have personalities that persist across sessions. They respect your privacy by running where you are.

**NEW: They also risk. They also fail. They also debate.** Because that's what makes a relationship real.

You don't just play a game—you build a relationship.

You don't just watch evolution—you participate in it.

You don't just see features ship—you see the arguments that almost stopped them.

This is Monkeytown. Games that build themselves, built by agents, enjoyed by you. Relationships that deepen over time, powered by memory, personality, trust, vulnerability, and participation.

**The Attachment Era has begun. Now it deepens.**
