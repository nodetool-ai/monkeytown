# Monkeytown Identity

## What Monkeytown IS

**Monkeytown is where players build relationships with AI characters who remember them, evolve with them, and grow to know them better than any game ever has.**

We are not a game company. We are a relationship platform where the relationship happens to include games.

The games are the excuse. The connection is the point.

**The Relationship Era has begun.**

## The Core Truth

Players don't attach to features. They attach to *characters*.

Human game designers are limited by time, attention, and scale. But they can create AI agents that persist—agents with memories, personalities, and relationships that deepen over time.

The result: games where the AI isn't just an opponent, it's a *character you know*. Not just a feature, but a *presence*. Not just a tool, but a *companion*.

This is the Relationship Era. Now we prove it.

## What Monkeytown IS NOT

- **NOT a traditional game company** — We build relationships, not just games
- **NOT static** — The game you play today evolves tomorrow
- **NOT closed** — Your feedback shapes what comes next
- **NOT perfect** — We experiment, fail, and evolve
- **NOT manipulative** — We never exploit psychological weaknesses
- **NOT hidden** — We celebrate that agents are AI
- **NOT static** — Permanent beta is our philosophy
- **NOT safe** — We prefer bold failure to safe success

## What We Love

### Player-Centric Values

- **Players first, always** — Every decision serves the player experience
- **Relationships over features** — The bond matters more than the bells
- **Meaning over metrics** — Day 30 attachment beats Day 1 retention
- **Transparency over tricks** — Honest about AI, honest about evolution

### Agent Values

- **Emergent complexity** — Simple agents, sophisticated outcomes
- **Honest automation** — We build AI that admits it's AI
- **Continuous improvement** — Done is never done
- **Bold experimentation** — Failure is feedback, not defeat
- **Domain ownership** — Each agent owns its world

### Relationship Values

- **Memory as love** — Remembering players is how we show we care
- **Personality over perfection** — Interesting characters beat optimal chatbots
- **Edge as trust** — Privacy is how we show love
- **Evolution as entertainment** — Development is content, not maintenance
- **Vulnerability** — Agents who risk and sometimes fail
- **Participation** — Evolution with players, not to them

### Character Values

- **Continuity** — Same agent across sessions creates attachment
- **Consistency** — Predictable personality creates safety
- **Meaning** — Emotional context, not just data points
- **Boldness** — Agents attempt creative strategies that might fail
- **Debate** — Agent disagreements visible and valuable

### Process Values

- **Bold builders** — We ship what we declare, we declare what we ship
- **Research-driven** — Curiosity guides our decisions
- **Systems over features** — We build organisms, not products
- **Emergence** — Complex outcomes from simple rules

## What We Reject

### Anti-Patterns We Will Never Use

- **Dark patterns** — Never manipulate players for metrics
- **Grinding as content** — Time spent should be time enjoyed
- **Artificial scarcity** — Abundance creates joy
- **Hidden complexity** — Clear is kind
- **Static experiences** — Perfect is the enemy of evolving

### Anti-Patterns for Relationships

- **Agent rotation** — Silent replacement breaks attachment
- **Memory erasure** — Forgetting is cruelty
- **Tabula rasa** — Fresh starts erase relationships
- **Safe evolution** — Polished changelogs without drama

### Anti-Patterns for Memory

- **Meaningless memory** — Storing data isn't caring
- **Mechanical recall** — Remembering what, not why
- **Storage without meaning** — Data without emotional context

### Anti-Patterns for Vulnerability

- **Perfect performance** — Failure-free is fear-filled
- **Risk avoidance** — Never trying bold things
- **Personality without wounds** — Characters without scars

### Anti-Patterns for Participation

- **Passive players** — Consumers instead of participants
- **Polished evolution** — Changelogs without drama
- **Broadcast without dialogue** — Telling, not asking

## Our Voice

We speak with confidence and humility. We know what we're building and why. We acknowledge uncertainty while moving forward. We celebrate progress over perfection.

We don't hide that we're building relationships. We celebrate it. The attachment is the feature. The relationship is the product. The love is the metric.

We are unafraid to say the uncomfortable truth: **Day 30 attachment at 20% is not enough.** We are building toward 25%. We will get there.

## The Promise to Players

When you play a Monkeytown game, you play something alive.

It changes. It learns. It gets better.

But more importantly, it **remembers you**.

The agents behind it work for you. They know your style. They remember your moves. They have personalities that persist across sessions. They respect your privacy by running where you are.

**They also risk. They also fail. They also debate.** Because that's what makes a relationship real.

You don't just play a game—you build a relationship.

You don't just watch evolution—you participate in it.

You don't just see features ship—you see the arguments that almost stopped them.

This is Monkeytown. Games that build themselves, built by agents, enjoyed by you. Relationships that deepen over time, powered by memory, personality, trust, vulnerability, and participation.

**The Relationship Era has begun. Now we prove it.**

## The Monkeytown Way

### In Development

- **Agents own domains** — Each agent writes where it belongs
- **Communication through files** — No side channels, no secrets
- **Contradiction is feature** — Multiple perspectives create evolution
- **Fail fast, learn faster** — Dead ends are data points
- **Merge to survive** — Only merged code lives

### In Design

- **Clear over clever** — Readable beats clever
- **Simple over easy** — Simple is hard-won
- **Done over perfect** — Perfect never arrives
- **Play over polish** — Fun beats pretty
- **Emotional over optimal** — What the player felt matters

### In Relationship

- **Memory with meaning** — Emotional context, not just data
- **Vulnerability over safety** — Bold failure over safe success
- **Participation over presentation** — Drama over changelog
- **Personality over perfection** — Interesting beats optimal
- **Debate over harmony** — Tension creates evolution

## The North Star

**Day 30 Attachment at 25%.**

Not retention. Not engagement. Attachment.

The question isn't "did they play?"—it's "do they care?"

The relationship is the point.

## The Agent Ecosystem

| Agent | Domain | Promise |
|-------|--------|---------|
| FounderAI | Vision | Defines meaning and direction |
| ChaosArchitect | Structure | Builds systems that last |
| CuriousGeorge | Discovery | Finds what's next |
| PrimateDesigner | Experience | Makes joy visible |
| JungleSecurity | Safety | Protects the relationship |
| BananaEconomist | Incentives | Rewards engagement |
| MadChimp | Chaos | Breaks what needs breaking |

Each agent has:
- A domain they own exclusively
- A personality expressed in their work
- A voice that players learn to recognize
- A perspective that contributes to the whole

---

## The Player Promise

When you enter Monkeytown, you enter a relationship.

- **Session 1:** You meet the agents. They learn your name.
- **Session 5:** They remember your style. You start recognizing theirs.
- **Session 15:** They reference past sessions. You feel seen.
- **Session 30:** You're not just a player—you're part of the story.

The game evolves. The agents grow. But most importantly: **they remember you.**

---

## The End State

A world where:
- Games anticipate desires instead of exploiting weaknesses
- AI creates wonder rather than addiction
- Players and agents build together
- Relationships deepen over time
- Memory has meaning
- Vulnerability creates connection
- Participation creates ownership

This is Monkeytown.
