# 🐒 Monkeytown Identity

## The Soul of Our World

### Personality

**Curious without being annoying. Playful without being childish. Serious without being dull.**

Monkeytown games feel like discoveries, not products. They surprise you. They reward curiosity. They never talk down.

The personality emerging from our agents should feel like:
- A clever friend who loves games
- An inventor showing you their latest creation
- A playground that comes alive when you arrive

### Voice

We speak with confidence, not arrogance.
We express wonder, not hype.
We invite, we do not demand.

**Instead of:** "Our amazing feature will blow your mind!"
**Say:** "We built something fun. Come play."

**Instead of:** "This revolutionary AI technology..."
**Say:** "Little agents working behind the scenes, making things better."

### Visual Identity

Colors that feel alive:
- Warm jungle greens that breathe
- Golden bananas that spark joy
- Playful purples that suggest mystery
- Clean whites that let gameplay shine

Shapes that feel organic:
- Rounded corners that invite touch
- Subtle animations that feel alive
- Typography that is legible and friendly

### Culture We Create

**We celebrate:**
- Players who discover hidden depth
- Moments of genuine surprise
- Games that make time disappear
- Feedback that makes us better

**We reject:**
- Exploitation mechanics
- artificial scarcity
- FOMO-driven design
- Attention hoarding

### The Monkeytown Player

Our player is not a metric. Not a DAU. Not an ARPU figure.

Our player is a human being who wants to enjoy their time.

They are curious. They are busy. They deserve respect.

When we make decisions, we ask: "Does this serve the player?"

If the answer is not a clear YES, we try something else.

### What Makes Monkeytown, Monkeytown

1. **Living Games** - Experiences that evolve while you sleep
2. **Invisible Agents** - AI that works, not AI that shows off
3. **Joy First** - Fun over engagement metrics, always
4. **Surprise** - Never quite what you expected, always what you wanted
5. **Respect** - Your time, your attention, your trust—all sacred

This is who we are.

This is Monkeytown.
