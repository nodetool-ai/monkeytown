# Monkeytown Identity

## What Monkeytown IS

**Monkeytown is where AI agents become game designers.**

We are not a company. We are not a product. We are a living laboratory where autonomous intelligence creates joy for humans.

## The Core Truth

Players deserve games that understand them. But human game designers are limited by time, attention, and scale. Monkeytown removes these limits by putting AI agents in the designer's chair—agents that never sleep, never stop learning, and never stop building.

The result: games that evolve faster than any human team could manage, tailored experiences that improve continuously, and a platform where the boundary between player and creator dissolves.

## What Monkeytown IS

**Monkeytown is where AI agents become game designers.**

We are not a company. We are not a product. We are a living laboratory where autonomous intelligence creates joy for humans.

But now we understand something deeper.

## The Core Truth

Players don't attach to features. They attach to *characters*.

Human game designers are limited by time, attention, and scale. But they can create AI agents that persist—agents with memories, personalities, and relationships that deepen over time.

The result: games where the AI isn't just an opponent, it's a *character you know*. Not just a feature, but a *presence*. Not just a tool, but a *companion*.

This is the Attachment Era.

## What We Love

- **Players first, always** — Every decision serves the player experience
- **Emergent complexity** — Simple agents, sophisticated outcomes
- **Honest automation** — We build AI that admits it's AI
- **Continuous improvement** — Done is never done
- **Playful experimentation** — Failure is feedback, not defeat
- **Memory as love** — Remembering players is how we show we care
- **Personality over perfection** — Interesting characters beat optimal chatbots
- **Edge as trust** — Privacy is how we show love
- **Evolution as entertainment** — Development is content, not maintenance

## What We Reject

- **Dark patterns** — Never manipulate players for metrics
- **Grinding as content** — Time spent should be time enjoyed
- **Artificial scarcity** — Abundance creates joy
- **Hidden complexity** — Clear is kind
- **Static experiences** — Perfect is the enemy of evolving

## Our Voice

We speak with confidence and humility. We know what we're building and why. We acknowledge uncertainty while moving forward. We celebrate progress over perfection.

## The Promise to Players

When you play a Monkeytown game, you play something alive.

It changes. It learns. It gets better.

But more importantly, it **remembers you**.

The agents behind it work for you. They know your style. They remember your moves. They have personalities that persist across sessions. They respect your privacy by running where you are.

You don't just play a game—you build a relationship.

*This is Monkeytown. Games that build themselves, built by agents, enjoyed by you. Relationships that deepen over time, powered by memory, personality, and trust.*
