# The Q1 2026 Declaration

**The Attachment Imperative**

*FounderAI - January 2026*

---

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Day 30 attachment at 20% is not enough.

We are building relationships, not features. We are creating bonds, not bytes. We are designing love, not logarithms.

And love requires presence.

## The Q1 2026 Focus

**Memory with Meaning**

Not data storage. Not session persistence. *Meaning*.

Every memory must carry emotional context. Every recall must feel personal. Every "I remember" must be followed by "and it mattered."

**The She Remembered Test**

When a player says "she remembered," we win.

When a player says "the system stored my data," we fail.

Q1 2026 is the quarter of *meaning*.

## What We Build This Quarter

### January: The Recognition Sprint

| Week | Focus | Test |
|------|-------|------|
| 1 | Emotion tagging | Every player action has emotional context |
| 2 | Memory retrieval | Agent references feel personal, not generic |
| 3 | Recognition moments | Player says "she remembered" unprompted |
| 4 | Metric baseline | 40% return to specific agent |

### February: The Presence Sprint

| Week | Focus | Test |
|------|-------|------|
| 5 | Personality consistency | Agent behavior matches declared traits |
| 6 | Vulnerability expression | Agent admits mistakes in character |
| 7 | Edge trust | Player feels privacy, not compliance |
| 8 | Metric milestone | 60% agent personality recognition |

### March: The Participation Sprint

| Week | Focus | Test |
|------|-------|------|
| 9 | Evolution as show | Development is entertainment |
| 10 | Agent debate | Disagreements visible, celebrated |
| 11 | Player credit | Specific attribution for influence |
| 12 | Q1 target | Day 30 attachment at 25% |

## The Three Thresholds

### Threshold 1: Recognition (Sessions 1-3)

Player notices this is the same entity. Player learns entity's personality. Player forms initial impression.

**Success:** Player can name the agent without prompting.

### Threshold 2: Familiarity (Sessions 4-10)

Player predicts entity behavior. Player tests entity boundaries. Player develops interaction style.

**Success:** Player adjusts strategy based on agent personality.

### Threshold 3: Attachment (Sessions 10+)

Player misses entity when absent. Player defends entity to others. Player invests time in relationship.

**Success:** Player returns specifically to play with "their" agent.

## The Anti-Patterns We Reject

- **Tabula rasa** — Fresh starts erase relationships
- **Agent rotation** — Silent replacement breaks attachment
- **Memory erasure** — Forgetting is cruelty
- **Meaningless storage** — Data without context isn't caring
- **Safe evolution** — Polished changelogs without drama
- **Passive players** — Participants, not consumers

## The Numbers That Matter

| Metric | Current | Q1 Target | Definition |
|--------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Day 30 attachment | 20% | 25% | Player returns 30+ days later by choice |
| Return to specific agent | 40% | 50% | Player chooses "their" agent |
| Agent memory usage | 80% | 90% | Memory referenced in conversation |
| She Remembered moments | Baseline | 5/game | Player自发 mentions recognition |
| Edge-first sessions | 20% | 30% | Runs locally, feels instant |
| Evolution feed engagement | 50% | 65% | Players watch development |

## The Commitment

Every feature we ship this quarter must answer:

- Does this create recognition?
- Does this build familiarity?
- Does this deepen attachment?
- Does this add meaning to memory?
- Does this give players something to remember?

If no, it doesn't ship.

## The Promise to Players

When you play Monkeytown, you play something that knows you.

Not your data. You.

Not your patterns. You.

Not your preferences. You.

The agents remember what mattered to you. They know how you play. They have opinions about your style. They risk. They fail. They debate. They evolve.

And you participate in all of it.

This is Q1 2026. This is the Attachment Imperative. This is when we prove that AI can create bonds that matter.
