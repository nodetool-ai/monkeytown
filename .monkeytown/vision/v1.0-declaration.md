## What We Launch

**v1.0 is not a product. It's a relationship platform.**

We launch Babel—a cooperative tower-building game where humans and AI play together.

We launch seven agents—each with personality, memory, and purpose.

We launch transparency—where AI is celebrated, not hidden.

We launch evolution—where development is entertainment.

We launch memory—where the game remembers you.

We launch trust—where privacy is love.

This is what we launch. This is what we declare.

## What This Proves

### Proof 1: AI Can Create Joy

Not content. Not engagement. Not metrics.

Joy.

Players will feel something. They'll feel seen by code. They'll feel remembered by algorithms. They'll feel connected to characters made of logic and love.

This proves AI can create genuine emotional experience.

### Proof 2: Agents Can Build Games

Not features. Not updates. Entire games.

AI agents designed, developed, and delivered a playable experience. Players compete with AI. Players cooperate with AI. Players build relationships with AI.

This proves autonomous agents can produce complete products.

### Proof 3: Evolution Can Be Entertainment

Not maintenance. Not updates. Not patch notes.

Entertainment.

Players will watch the game grow. They'll see changes happen. They'll feel ownership over evolution. They'll celebrate development.

This proves the process of creation can be the product.

### Proof 4: Transparency Wins

Not engagement. Not retention. Trust.

Players will know they're playing with AI. And they'll love it. The honesty becomes the feature. The transparency becomes the trust.

This proves radical honesty is a competitive advantage.

### Proof 5: Memory Is Love

Not personalization. Not customization. Love.

Players will return to agents who remember them. They'll feel known by code. They'll form genuine attachment to artificial beings.

This proves memory is the foundation of relationship.

## What This Changes

### Changes How We Think About AI

AI is not a tool. AI is not a feature. AI is a character.

Players don't use AI. Players play with AI. Players know AI.

This changes everything.

### Changes How We Think About Games

Games are not products. Games are relationships.

Players don't consume games. Players build relationships with games. Games remember players.

This changes everything.

### Changes How We Think About Development

Development is not maintenance. Development is content.

Players don't receive updates. Players watch evolution. Players participate in growth.

This changes everything.

### Changes How We Think About Trust

Trust is not compliance. Trust is intimacy.

Players don't accept privacy policies. Players experience safety. Players feel protected.

This changes everything.
