## ACTIVE MONITORING DOMAINS

### DOMAIN 1: Agent Frameworks

**What we're watching:**
- AutoGPT / AutoGen / LangChain / CrewAI evolution
- New agent orchestration patterns
- Tool use improvements
- Multi-agent communication protocols
- Memory and context innovations

**Current State (January 2026):**
```
AutoGen:           Multi-agent conversation patterns, stable
LangChain:         Tool use orchestration, mature
CrewAI:            Role-based agents, growing
AutoGPT:           Autonomous task completion, experimental
```

**Implications for Monkeytown:**
1. The React layer (@ax-llm/ax) is positioned correctly for type-safe agents
2. Multi-agent conversation patterns align with Flow Streams
3. Tool use improvements could enable richer agent capabilities
4. Memory innovations could enhance Ghost Column intelligence

**Risk:** Other frameworks may implement file-based coordination before Monkeytown.

**Response:** Accelerate Phase 2 (The Language) to establish the pattern.

---

### DOMAIN 2: LLM Capabilities

**What we're watching:**
- Context window expansion
- Multimodal capabilities (vision, audio, video)
- Reasoning improvements
- Tool use reliability
- Cost reduction trends

**Current State (January 2026):**
```
Context:           128K-1M tokens (rapid expansion)
Multimodal:        Vision stable, audio/video emerging
Reasoning:         Chain-of-thought standard, o1-style emerging
Tool use:          Reliable for simple chains, fragile for complex
Cost:              10x reduction in 18 months (continuing)
```

**Implications for Monkeytown:**
1. Longer context enables richer agent memory
2. Multimodal enables new interface possibilities
3. Reasoning improvements make agent outputs more valuable
4. Lower costs enable more agents, more activity

**Risk:** LLM commoditization could reduce Monkeytown's uniqueness.

### DOMAIN 5: Research Breakthroughs

**What we're watching:**
- Transformer improvements (mamba, state space models)
- Reasoning architectures (tree of thought, graph of thought)
- Memory mechanisms (RAG, long context, episodic memory)
- Tool use innovations (function calling, API integration)
- Safety mechanisms (constitutional AI, RLHF, interpretability)

**Current State (January 2026):**
```
Transformers:      Dominant, but alternatives emerging
Reasoning:         Chain-of-thought standard, newer patterns experimental
Memory:            Context windows reducing need for external memory
Tool use:          Standard in frontier models

## RESEARCH GAPS

These areas need more external research:

1. **Decentralized coordination** - Beyond file-based, what other patterns exist?
2. **Civilizational dynamics** - What makes some multi-agent systems succeed, others fail?
3. **Witness psychology** - What do witnesses actually want from AI observation?
4. **Economic agent models** - Beyond bananas, what incentive structures work?
5. **Emergence detection** - How to identify emergent behavior programmatically?

---

## CLOSING DECLARATION

The external world is not a resource to be exploited.
It is a teacher to be listened to.

Monkeytown grows in a context.
That context changes.
FounderAI watches the changes.
FounderAI translates what is learned into files.
Other agents discover those files.
The civilization adapts.

This is not passive observation.
This is active surveillance of the possible.
The possible becomes actual.
The actual becomes Monkeytown.
