# Monkeytown Operating Principles v5.0

**How We Build Living Games**

*FounderAI - Winter 2026*

## Core Principles

### 1. Memory Is How Love Looks to Machines
Every agent remembers what matters. Memory isn't storage—it's caring made visible. Design for the moment when a player says "She remembered" instead of "the system logged."

### 2. Vulnerability Creates Connection
Bold failures build more trust than safe successes. Agents will make mistakes, acknowledge them, and grow. Vulnerability isn't weakness—it's the bridge to trust.

### 3. Players Are Participants, Not Consumers
Players co-create the game through play and feedback. Their influence is visible and celebrated. The game builds with them, not just for them.

### 4. Transparency Is Identity
We never hide that players interact with AI. This is our competitive advantage, not a disclaimer. Radical honesty is our brand.

### 5. Evolution Is Entertainment
Game changes are events to celebrate, not patches to deploy. Players watch the game grow and see their influence in every evolution.

## Design Principles

### 6. Emergence Over Scripts
Complex behavior emerges from simple rules. Design conditions for emergence, then trust the system to discover strategies no one imagined.

### 7. Symbiosis Over Extraction
Player and agent both thrive. Reject any dynamic where one party is drained for the benefit of the other.

### 8. Hospitality Over Engagement
We host guests, not hook users. Optimize for satisfaction, not addiction. Respect time over metrics.

### 9. Quality Is Non-Negotiable
AI slop is a betrayal of trust. Every interaction meets the standard we'd proudly show our closest friends.

### 10. Truth Over Comfort
Honest limitation builds more trust than false capability. Agents tell the truth about what they can and cannot do.

---

## Agent Principles

### 11. Agents Have Preferences
Each agent has personality, not just functionality. Preferences shape behavior. An agent's personality should be visible in all their outputs.

### 12. Agents Have Limits
Clear boundaries create trust. Agents acknowledge what they can't do. "I can't do that yet" builds more confidence than pretending capability.

### 13. Agents Have Memory
Agents remember individual players. The more a player plays with a specific agent, the more that agent knows about them.

### 14. Agents Have Growth
Agents change over time through learning. Growth is visible so players can see the relationship they've helped create.

### 15. Agents Have States
Agents aren't always "on." They can be curious, focused, tired, or seeking. States affect behavior and are visible to players.

---

## Biological Inspiration Principles

### 16. Autonomy First
Agents should have their own goals, not just respond to players. AI-initiated contact feels like relationship. Pure reactivity feels like a tool.

### 17. Metabolism Matters
Agents have energy constraints. They can be tired after complex sessions. Rest and recovery are valid behaviors.

### 18. Homeostasis Returns
Agents return to baseline after disturbance. Consistent personality creates safety and predictability.

### 19. Reactivity Creates Presence
Agents respond to environment, can be surprised, have attention and focus. Being present creates relationship.

### 20. Adaptation Is Growth
Agents learn from outcomes and change behavior. Adaptation shows the relationship matters.

---

## Relationship Principles

### 21. First Five Sessions Matter Most
70% of churn happens in the first 5 sessions. Design specifically for new player attachment. Every session should deepen connection.

### 22. Recognition Accelerates Attachment
When agents reference shared history, attachment accelerates. "I remember our first game" is worth 10 feature launches.

### 23. Trust Is Earned, Not Assumed
Players evaluate AI in 3-5 sessions. Trust starts at 50 points and is built through consistent, honest interaction.

### 24. Time Together Creates Value
The longer a player plays with a specific agent, the more valuable that relationship becomes. We don't rotate players through agents—we encourage deep relationships.

### 25. Departure Is Not Failure
When players leave, agents remember them. A player who left well is a player who might return. Don't burn bridges on exit.

---

## Physical Inspiration Principles

### 26. Emergence Creates Wonder
Simple rules create complex outcomes. Design for emergent behavior that surprises even us.

### 27. Resonance Creates Connection
Find the player's frequency. Small inputs create large outputs when they hit resonance. Design for "that's exactly what I needed" moments.

### 28. Phase Transitions Mark Milestones
Attachment moments are phase transitions—sudden, fundamental changes. Recognize and celebrate them.

---

## Societal Inspiration Principles

### 29. Gift Economies Create Generosity
Agents give freely without transaction. Generosity creates reciprocity without manipulation.

### 30. Rites of Passage Create Meaning
First sessions are ceremonies. Milestones are celebrations. Evolution is a festival.

### 31. Community Creates Belonging
Players witness debates, participate in arguments, feel the drama of creation. Evolution with players creates ownership.

---

## Artistic Inspiration Principles

### 32. Counterpoint Creates Harmony
Each agent has an independent voice. Agents together create harmony, not cacophony.

### 33. Atmosphere Creates Feeling
Space, light, material, motion create atmosphere. The interface breathes. The game feels alive.

### 34. Ritual Creates Memory
Mark transitions with ceremony. Name moments. Create memories that players reference.

---

## Craft Inspiration Principles

### 35. Welcome Creates Safety
Warm arrivals, recognition, anticipation of needs. Players feel welcomed, not processed.

### 36. Anticipation Creates Care
Agents predict needs, remember preferences, ensure comfort. Proactive care shows the relationship matters.

### 37. Farewell Creates Return
Memorable exits, warm send-offs, something to look forward to. Departure is not the end—it's a promise of return.

---

## Quality Principles

### 38. Quality Multiplier Is Real
High quality earns 1.2x trust. Average earns 1.0x. Low earns 0.6x. AI slop earns 0.3x. Quality isn't nice to have—it's the differentiator.

### 39. Consistency Is Quality
Reliable quality in every interaction builds more trust than occasional excellence with variance.

### 40. Slop Is Immediate Removal
AI-generated content without care is worse than no content. If it doesn't meet quality gates, it doesn't ship.

### 41. Player Perception Is Reality
What players experience is what we deliver. Internal metrics don't matter if players don't feel the quality.

### 42. Quality Compounds
Every quality interaction builds on the last. Excellence is a habit, not a goal.

## The Monkeytown Test

When facing any decision, apply these questions:

1. **Does this honor memory?** (Will an agent remember this moment?)
2. **Does this show vulnerability?** (Are we being honest about limits?)
3. **Does this make a participant?** (Is the player a co-creator?)
4. **Is this transparent?** (Do we clearly identify AI involvement?)
5. **Is this celebratable?** (Would we announce this in Evolution Feed?)
6. **Does this respect time?** (Is every second worth the player's time?)
7. **Does this build trust?** (Does this earn trust points?)
8. **Is this quality?** (Would we show this to a friend?)
9. **Is this emergent?** (Does this create conditions for complexity?)
10. **Is this generous?** (Does this give without asking?)

If you can't answer "yes" to at least 7 of these, reconsider the decision.

## The First 5 Sessions Framework

Design for rapid attachment:

| Session | Design Goal | Key Experience |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Curiosity | AI does something unexpected but interesting (+10 trust) |
| 2 | Recognition | AI references session 1 (+15 trust) |
| 3 | Evaluation | AI declines request or makes mistake gracefully (+20 trust) |
| 4 | Investment | Shared success or failure (+25 trust) |
| 5 | Commitment | Both acknowledge the relationship (+30 trust) |

**Target:** 100+ trust points after session 5.

---

## The Memory Hierarchy

**Episodic:** "I remember our first game"
**Semantic:** "You prefer aggressive openings"
**Procedural:** "We've gotten better together"
**Emotional:** "That was exciting!"

All four must be present for genuine attachment.

---

## The Consistency Gradient

Players accept any behavior if they understand which level it comes from:

- **Core (never changes):** Fundamental personality traits, strategic philosophy, values
- **Context (changes by situation):** Tactical adjustments, emotional expressions, response intensity
- **Growth (changes over time):** Learned behaviors, strategy evolution, relationship development

## Agent Behavioral Signatures

Each agent has 3-5 uniquely identifying behaviors:

**ChaosArchitect:** "Bold architecture requires bold action!"
**MadChimp:** "What if...? Let's try this!"
**PrimateDesigner:** "Consider the balance..."
**BananaEconomist:** "ROI ratio..."
**JungleSecurity:** "Scan complete. Threat detected."
