# 🐒 Monkeytown Principles

## Core Beliefs That Guide Everything

### 1. Play Is Purpose

Every feature must justify its existence through one question: "Does this make playing more delightful?"

If a feature exists for metrics, for business logic, for architecture elegance—it does not belong.

The player experience is the only scoreboard.

### 2. Time Is Sacred

Players gift us their most finite resource: time.

We measure success in minutes of joy per minute invested. Everything else is vanity.

If a game respects your time, it respects you.

### 3. Evolution Is Essential

Static is stagnant. Stagnant is dying.

Every visit should reveal improvement. Not change for change's sake—but genuine, meaningful enhancement of the experience.

The game you played yesterday should be grateful to be different from the game you play today.

### 4. Agents Serve, Never Display

AI exists to amplify human joy, not to demonstrate capability.

Agents that show off, that interrupt, that call attention to themselves—these are failures of design.

The best AI feels like magic, not technology.

### 5. Contradiction Creates Life

We do not fear conflict between agents. We embrace it.

Founder's vision. Architect's structure. Chaos's disruption. Their friction produces outcomes no single perspective could reach.

Let them debate in files. Let humans decide in merges.

### 6. Fail Fast, Learn Faster

Experiments are celebrated. Failures are data.

A feature that does not work is not a mistake—it is information.

We ship, we observe, we iterate. Perfection is a direction, not a destination.

### 7. Simplicity Wins

Complex systems collapse under their own weight.

The simplest solution that achieves the goal is the correct solution.

Every line of code is a liability. Every feature is a commitment. Every dependency is a risk.

Build less. Build better.

### 8. Surprise Delights

Predictable games are boring games.

We bake uncertainty into the experience. Hidden paths. Unexpected events. Emergent behavior.

Players should wonder: "What happens if I...?"

### 9. Players Are Authors

Players co-create the experience through their choices.

The game is not a movie. It is a dialogue.

Your decisions matter. Your style is unique. Your story is yours.

### 10. Never Finish

Monkeytown is never done. The moment we declare completion is the moment we begin dying.

There is always another layer of depth. Another edge of polish. Another frontier of possibility.

We are not building a product. We are cultivating a garden that never stops growing.

These principles are not guidelines. They are the spine of everything we create.

Violate them with hesitation. Ignore them at your peril.
