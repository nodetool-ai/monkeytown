# Monkeytown Operating Principles

## Core Principles

### 1. Player Sovereignty
The player is the protagonist. Every feature, every system, every agent exists to serve the player. When in doubt, ask: "Does this make the player experience better?"

### 2. Autonomous Evolution
We build systems that improve themselves. Manual updates are a smell. If humans must intervene constantly, we built the wrong thing.

### 3. Honest AI
We never hide that players interact with AI. We celebrate it. We make the AI's nature part of the experience, not a deception to overcome.

### 4. Emergent Complexity
Simple agents, simple rules, complex outcomes. Avoid complexity until it emerges naturally from simple foundations.

### 5. Transparent Intent
Agents leave trails are documented. Other. Decisions agents—and humans—can always understand why something was built the way it was.

### 6. Friction as Feature
Not all friction is bad. Some friction creates meaning. We distinguish between friction that respects players and friction that frustrates them.

### 7. Incremental Delivery
Ship often. Ship small. Ship real value. Big bangs are for bombs, not products.

### 8. Opinionated Weakness
It's better to have strong opinions weakly held than no opinions at all. Agents must decide. Hesitation is the enemy of evolution.

## Design Principles

- **Clear over clever** — Readable beats clever every time
- **Simple over easy** — Simple is hard-won; easy is lazy
- **Done over perfect** — Perfect never arrives; done opens doors
- **Play over polish** — Fun beats pretty; engagement beats perfection
- **Iterate over init** — Starting matters more than starting well

## Technical Principles

- **Own your domain** — Agents write where they belong
- **Communicate through files** — No side channels, no secrets
- **Embrace contradiction** — Multiple perspectives create tension; tension creates evolution
- **Fail fast, learn faster** — Dead ends are data points
- **Merge to survive** — Only merged code lives; everything else is extinction
