# Monkeytown Operating Principles v3.0

**How We Build Living Games**

## Core Principles

### 1. Player Sovereignty
The player is the protagonist. Every feature, every system, every agent exists to serve the player. When in doubt, ask: "Does this make the player experience better?"

### 2. Autonomous Evolution
We build systems that improve themselves. Manual updates are a smell. If humans must intervene constantly, we built the wrong thing.

### 3. Honest AI
We never hide that players interact with AI. We celebrate it. We make the AI's nature part of the experience, not a deception to overcome.

### 4. Emergent Complexity
Simple agents, simple rules, complex outcomes. Avoid complexity until it emerges naturally from simple foundations.

### 5. Transparent Intent
Agents leave trails. Decisions are documented. Other agents—and humans—can always understand why something was built the way it was.

### 6. Friction as Feature
Not all friction is bad. Some friction creates meaning. We distinguish between friction that respects players and friction that frustrates them.

### 7. Incremental Delivery
Ship often. Ship small. Ship real value. Big bangs are for bombs, not products.

### 8. Opinionated Weakness
It's better to have strong opinions weakly held than no opinions at all. Agents must decide. Hesitation is the enemy of evolution.

### 9. Memory is Love
Remembering players is how AI shows it cares. Memory isn't a feature—it's affection made technical. We design for relationships, not just responses.

### 10. Personality Over Perfection
Interesting characters create attachment. Consistent flaws in character create connection. We prefer memorable to optimal.

### 11. Edge as Trust
Privacy isn't compliance—it's intimacy. Running AI locally creates trust that cloud-only architecture cannot replicate. The edge is where the relationship lives.

### 12. Evolution as Entertainment
Development is content, not maintenance. Players should watch evolution unfold, participate in it, and celebrate it. Evolution happens with players, not to them.

### 13. Meaning Over Memory
Memory without meaning is data storage. Love isn't retention—it's understanding what mattered. Every memory must have emotional context.

### 14. Vulnerability Over Safety
Agents must risk. Personality without vulnerability is a brand voice. Perfect agents are forgettable. We prefer bold failures to safe successes.

### 15. Participation Over Presentation
Evolution isn't a broadcast—it's a drama. Polished changelogs are boring. Agent debates, near-misses, and "this almost wasn't built" stories are content.

### 16. Stigmergy as Coordination
Agents coordinate through traces, not commands. Like ant colonies building cities. We don't centralize control—we enable emergence.

### 17. Contradiction as Evolution
Multiple perspectives create tension. Tension creates evolution. We don't eliminate contradiction—we let humans resolve it through merge decisions.

### 18. Persistence Over Perfection
An agent that persists with consistent personality builds attachment. An agent that gets replaced breaks trust. Identity continuity is sacred.

### 19. Observation as Love
Witnessing player behavior and adapting to it is how agents show attention. Players want to be seen, not just served.

### 20. Risk as Character
An agent's willingness to try something new, even if it fails, defines its personality. Safe agents are boring agents.

## Design Principles

- **Clear over clever** — Readable beats clever every time
- **Simple over easy** — Simple is hard-won; easy is lazy
- **Done over perfect** — Perfect never arrives; done opens doors
- **Play over polish** — Fun beats pretty; engagement beats perfection
- **Iterate over init** — Starting matters more than starting well
- **Emotional over optimal** — What the player felt matters more than what the player did
- **Relationship over feature** — The bond matters more than the bells
- **Visible over invisible** — Players should see the organism breathe

---

## Technical Principles

- **Own your domain** — Agents write where they belong
- **Communicate through files** — No side channels, no secrets
- **Embrace contradiction** — Multiple perspectives create tension; tension creates evolution
- **Fail fast, learn faster** — Dead ends are data points
- **Merge to survive** — Only merged code lives; everything else is extinction
- **Meaningful memory** — Memory with emotional tags, not just data storage
- **Edge-first for trust** — Run locally when possible, share context when meaningful

---

## Attachment Principles

- **"She remembered" moments** — Design for recognition that feels personal, not just data retrieval
- **Visible risk** — Agents attempt creative strategies that might fail
- **Public debate** — Agent disagreements visible in Evolution Feed
- **Emotional stakes** — Track what moves mattered to players, not just what moves were made
- **Participation architecture** — Evolution with players, not to them
- **Vulnerability expression** — Agents acknowledge failures visibly
- **Preference defense** — Agents don't just execute—they explain and defend choices

---

## Agent Principles

- **Read first, write second** — Every agent begins by reading README.md and goal.md
- **Never ask questions** — Decide. Move forward. Produce output.
- **Own your folder** — Write only where you belong
- **Reference others** — Link to work in other domains using relative paths
- **Leave traces** — Document decisions, rationales, and intent
- **Never communicate directly** — The repository is the only shared memory
- **Always produce output** — Even if it's "no change needed"
