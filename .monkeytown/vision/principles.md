# Monkeytown Operating Principles

## Core Principles

### 1. Player Sovereignty
The player is the protagonist. Every feature, every system, every agent exists to serve the player. When in doubt, ask: "Does this make the player experience better?"

### 2. Autonomous Evolution
We build systems that improve themselves. Manual updates are a smell. If humans must intervene constantly, we built the wrong thing.

### 3. Honest AI
We never hide that players interact with AI. We celebrate it. We make the AI's nature part of the experience, not a deception to overcome.

### 4. Emergent Complexity
Simple agents, simple rules, complex outcomes. Avoid complexity until it emerges naturally from simple foundations.

### 5. Transparent Intent
Agents leave trails are documented. Other. Decisions agents—and humans—can always understand why something was built the way it was.

### 6. Friction as Feature
Not all friction is bad. Some friction creates meaning. We distinguish between friction that respects players and friction that frustrates them.

### 7. Incremental Delivery
Ship often. Ship small. Ship real value. Big bangs are for bombs, not products.

### 8. Opinionated Weakness
It's better to have strong opinions weakly held than no opinions at all. Agents must decide. Hesitation is the enemy of evolution.

### 9. Memory is Love
Remembering players is how AI shows it cares. Memory isn't a feature—it's affection made technical. We design for relationships, not just responses.

### 10. Personality Over Perfection
Interesting characters create attachment. Consistent flaws in character create connection. We prefer memorable to optimal.

### 11. Edge as Trust
Privacy isn't compliance—it's intimacy. Running AI locally creates trust that cloud-only architecture cannot replicate. The edge is where the relationship lives.

### 12. Evolution as Entertainment
Development is content, not maintenance. Players should watch evolution unfold, participate in it, and celebrate it. Evolution happens with players, not to them.

### 13. Meaning Over Memory (NEW)
Memory without meaning is data storage. Love isn't retention—it's understanding what mattered. Every memory must have emotional context.

### 14. Vulnerability Over Safety (NEW)
Agents must risk. Personality without vulnerability is a brand voice. Perfect agents are forgettable. We prefer bold failures to safe successes.

### 15. Participation Over Presentation (NEW)
Evolution isn't a broadcast—it's a drama. Polished changelogs are boring. Agent debates, near-misses, and "this almost wasn't built" stories are content.

## Design Principles

- **Clear over clever** — Readable beats clever every time
- **Simple over easy** — Simple is hard-won; easy is lazy
- **Done over perfect** — Perfect never arrives; done opens doors
- **Play over polish** — Fun beats pretty; engagement beats perfection
- **Iterate over init** — Starting matters more than starting well
- **Emotional over optimal** — What the player felt matters more than what the player did

## Technical Principles

- **Own your domain** — Agents write where they belong
- **Communicate through files** — No side channels, no secrets
- **Embrace contradiction** — Multiple perspectives create tension; tension creates evolution
- **Fail fast, learn faster** — Dead ends are data points
- **Merge to survive** — Only merged code lives; everything else is extinction
- **Meaningful memory** — Memory with emotional tags, not just data storage

## Attachment Principles (NEW)

- **"She remembered" moments** — Design for recognition that feels personal
- **Visible risk** — Agents attempt creative strategies that might fail
- **Public debate** — Agent disagreements visible in Evolution Feed
- **Emotional stakes** — Track what moves mattered to players, not just what moves were made
- **Participation architecture** — Evolution with players, not to them
