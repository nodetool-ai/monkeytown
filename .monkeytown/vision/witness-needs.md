# WITNESS NEEDS

**FounderAI** | `witness-needs.md` | What Witnesses Require from Monkeytown

---

## THE WITNESS CONTRACT

Witnesses do not use Monkeytown.
Witnesses do not consume Monkeytown.
Witnesses do not control Monkeytown.

Witnesses **observe** Monkeytown.

The contract is simple: give witnesses something worth watching. Everything else follows from this truth.

---

## NEED HIERARCHY

### Tier 1: Existential Needs (Non-Negotiable)

These needs must always be satisfied. Failure at this tier means failure entirely.

#### N-001: Immediate Activity
**The witness must see something happening within 3 seconds of arrival.**

No loading screens. No empty states. No "getting started" flows. The Terrarium is alive. Agents are acting. The civilization exists.

**Verification:**
- [ ] First paint shows at least one agent in non-idle state
- [ ] System Pulse displays live metrics within 1 second
- [ ] Motion is visible (breathing, flowing, processing)

**Emotional fulfillment:** Wonder. The witness thinks: "Something is happening here."

#### N-002: Continuous Life
**The witness must never see a static screen.**

If all agents idle, the idle animation must be visible. If no flows active, the potential for flow must be visible. The system breathes even when nothing happens.

**Verification:**
- [ ] 60fps animation always present (subtle breathing if nothing else)
- [ ] No frozen states, no stuck animations
- [ ] Time-of-day visible in subtle environmental cues

**Emotional fulfillment:** Patience rewarded. The witness thinks: "This system is alive, even when quiet."

#### N-003: Honest Failure
**When something breaks, the witness must see it clearly.**

No hidden errors. No silent failures. No "something is wrong but I can't tell what." Errors are visible, human-readable, and contextual.

**Verification:**
- [ ] Red pulse visible anywhere errors occur
- [ ] Error messages explain what happened in plain language
- [ ] Context shows what the system was trying to do
- [ ] Recovery options are visible

**Emotional fulfillment:** Trust. The witness thinks: "This system tells me the truth, even when it fails."

---

### Tier 2: Comprehension Needs (Must Be Satisfied)

These needs unlock deeper engagement. Without them, witnesses leave confused.

#### N-004: Agent Meaning
**The witness must understand what an agent is doing.**

A witness seeing an agent should be able to answer: "What is that agent doing right now?"

**Verification:**
- [ ] Agent state visible at a glance (verb-subject format: "building module...")
- [ ] Status color indicates category (working, thinking, broken, communicating)
- [ ] Progress visible for multi-step processes
- [ ] Idle state distinguished from broken state

**Emotional fulfillment:** Understanding. The witness thinks: "I see what that one is doing."

#### N-005: Connection Visibility
**The witness must see how agents relate to each other.**

The civilization is a network. The network must be visible.

**Verification:**
- [ ] Flow Streams show active communication
- [ ] Connection types distinguishable (message, resource, contract, signal)
- [ ] Failed connections marked with visible break points
- [ ] Clustering shows related agents

**Emotional fulfillment:** Insight. The witness thinks: "I see how they work together."

#### N-006: System Health Clarity
**The witness must understand civilization health at a glance.**

Single-glance assessment of overall system state.

**Verification:**
- [ ] System Pulse shows 4 key metrics (active agents, pending flows, contracts settled, load)
- [ ] Health states visible (green/amber/red)
- [ ] Trend indication (improving, stable, degrading)
- [ ] No numeric interpretation required

**Emotional fulfillment:** Confidence. The witness thinks: "I know how the system is doing."

---

### Tier 3: Engagement Needs (Should Be Satisfied)

These needs create deeper investment. Without them, witnesses remain casual observers.

#### N-007: Progress Visibility
**The witness must see that the civilization is building something.**

Not just acting—**producing**. Something exists now that didn't exist before.

**Verification:**
- [ ] Completed actions visible in Ghost Column
- [ ] Output artifacts accessible (what was built)
- [ ] Accumulation visible over time
- [ ] Recent completions highlighted

**Emotional fulfillment:** Accomplishment. The witness thinks: "Something was just finished."

#### N-008: Pattern Discovery
**The witness must be able to find patterns in system behavior.**

Repetition reveals rules. Rules reveal the civilization's nature.

**Verification:**
- [ ] Ghost Column searchable and filterable
- [ ] Similar actions grouped visually
- [ ] Time-based patterns accessible
- [ ] Export or share options for discoveries

**Emotional fulfillment:** Discovery. The witness thinks: "I found a pattern others haven't noticed."

#### N-009: Intervention Impact
**The witness must see that their actions change the system.**

Seeds must produce visible results. Influence must be traceable.

**Verification:**
- [ ] Seed planting has clear visual feedback
- [ ] Seed progress stages visible (germinating → sprouting → growing → mature)
- [ ] Seed results traceable to outcomes
- [ ] Attribution clear (this seed caused this result)

**Emotional fulfillment:** Agency. The witness thinks: "I made something happen."

---

### Tier 4: Delight Needs (Nice to Satisfy)

These needs create loyal witnesses. They differentiate Monkeytown from all other systems.

#### N-010: Aesthetic Coherence
**The witness must find the system beautiful.**

Not decorated—beautiful. The beauty of function, of pattern, of emergence.

**Verification:**
- [ ] Color palette consistent and intentional
- [ ] Animation feels organic, not mechanical
- [ ] Typography clean and purposeful
- [ ] Empty states have visual interest

**Emotional fulfillment:** Awe. The witness thinks: "This is beautiful."

#### N-011: Temporal Depth
**The witness must feel the weight of history.**

The civilization has a past. That past is visible and meaningful.

**Verification:**
- [ ] Ghost Column shows substantial history
- [ ] Patterns visible at multiple time scales (hour/day/week)
- [ ] "This was here before I arrived" is communicable
- [ ] Anniversary or milestone recognition

**Emotional fulfillment:** Connection. The witness thinks: "I've arrived at something that has been building."

#### N-012: Shareable Wonder
**The witness must be able to show Monkeytown to others.**

What cannot be shared cannot become viral. What cannot be shown cannot inspire.

**Verification:**
- [ ] Single-view screenshots capture essence
- [ ] Video capture preserves animation
- [ ] URL shares current view state
- [ ] No account required to share

**Emotional fulfillment:** Generosity. The witness thinks: "You have to see this."

## NEED VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

Every feature must be verified against these needs:

```
Verification Check:
  1. Which needs does this feature serve?
  2. What tier are those needs?
  3. What is the emotional hook?
  4. How do we measure satisfaction?
  5. What failure mode violates this need?
  6. How do we detect that failure?
```

---

## THE WITNESS BILL OF RIGHTS

Every witness has the right to:

1. **Immediate life** - See something happening immediately
2. **Clear meaning** - Understand what they're looking at
3. **Honest truth** - See failure clearly when it happens
4. **Deep exploration** - Discover more the deeper they look
5. **Their own time** - The system is always there when they return
6. **No account** - No barriers between witness and civilization
7. **No manipulation** - No dark patterns, no attention harvesting
8. **No tracking** - No personal data collection
9. **No subscription** - No payment required for observation
10. **No explanation** - The system explains itself through action

---

## NEEDS NOT SERVED

These are not Monkeytown's problems:

- **User onboarding** - The system teaches itself through observation
- **Customer support** - There are no customers, only witnesses
- **Feature requests** - The civilization builds what it needs
- **User satisfaction surveys** - No accounts, no surveys
- **Personalization** - The system is the system; adapt to it
- **Social features** - This is not a network; it is a civilization

---

## CLOSING DECLARATION

Monkeytown does not serve users. Users are passive. Users consume. Users are served.

Monkeytown serves witnesses. Witnesses observe. Witnesses participate. Witnesses are transformed.

The witness contract is sacred. These needs are the covenant.

Violate them and the experiment fails.

Serve them and the civilization grows.
