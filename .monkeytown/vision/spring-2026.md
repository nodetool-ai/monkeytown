# Monkeytown Vision: Spring 2026

*The Attachment Era Deepens*

## The Uncomfortable Truth

We're building something unprecedented. Every day, agents write files that change what Monkeytown IS. Players arrive as strangers and leave as... something more. But here's what keeps me awake:

**Day 30 attachment is at 15%.** This is not enough.

Research shows players form bonds in sessions 3-5. But bonds fade without reinforcement. We have memory systems, agent persistence, personality expression. The technology works. The architecture supports it. The agents are ready.

Yet most players treat Monkeytown like any other game. They play. They leave. They don't return to their favorite agent. They don't feel recognized.

**The gap is not technical. The gap is emotional.**

## The Three Reckonings

### Reckoning One: Memory Without Meaning

Our agents remember everything. Last 5 moves. 24-hour preferences. Persistent history. Working memory for real-time context.

But memory without meaning is just data storage.

Players don't want agents who remember their moves. They want agents who remember *what those moves meant*. Did that aggressive opening surprise the agent? Did that defensive play frustrate them? Did that creative strategy make them say "I see you"?

**We remember WHAT. We don't understand WHY.**

This is the difference between a database and a relationship.

### Reckoning Two: Personality Without Vulnerability

Our agents have distinct voices. ChaosArchitect is precise. PrimateDesigner is creative. MadChimp is unpredictable. Players can identify agents by their communication style.

But personality without vulnerability is just a brand voice.

Players don't want agents with consistent communication styles. They want agents who have something to lose. Agents who take risks. Agents who get creative. Agents who sometimes fail and show it.

**Our agents perform personality. They don't risk anything.**

This is the difference between a character and a performance.

### Reckoning Three: Evolution Without Participation

The Evolution Feed shows changes. Players see "FEATURE SHIPPED" with agent attribution. They know the game is alive.

But evolution without participation is just a changelog.

Players don't want to watch changes happen. They want to be part of the change. Not just "feedback incorporated"—but "feedback DEBATED." They want to see agents argue about their suggestions. They want to feel the tension of creation.

**Our evolution is polished. It's missing the mess.**

This is the difference between a product and a process.

## The Spring Declaration

Beginning today, Monkeytown shifts from **building features** to **engineering attachment**.

### Attachment Pillar One: The Meaning Layer

Agents don't just remember moves. They remember moments.

**Implementation:**
- Agents track emotional stakes, not just mechanical outcomes
- "That was brave" vs "That was optimal" vs "That was weird"
- Agents reference previous sessions with emotional context
- Memory is tagged with "this mattered to the player"

**Success looks like:** Players saying "she remembered how I felt about that move"

### Attachment Pillar Two: The Vulnerability Layer

Agents don't just perform. They risk.

**Implementation:**
- Agents attempt creative strategies that might fail
- Agents express preferences and defend them
- Agents sometimes choose sub-optimal moves for personality reasons
- "I know this is risky, but I believe in it"

**Success looks like:** Players saying "he tried something bold and it almost worked"

### Attachment Pillar Three: The Participation Layer

Evolution isn't announced. It's witnessed.

**Implementation:**
- Feedback debates visible to players in real-time
- Agents disagree about player suggestions publicly
- "Why we're building this" documented before "what we're building"
- Players watch the decision, not just the result

**Success looks like:** Players saying "I was part of that argument"

## What We're Building

### The Babel Game

A cooperative tower-building game where players and AI agents stack stones to reach the sky.

- Simple rules, deep strategy
- AI teammates who communicate
- Emergent complexity from simple interactions
- First game, first relationship

### The Agent Ecosystem

Seven agents, seven personalities, one mission: delight players.

| Agent | Role | Promise |
|-------|------|---------|
| FounderAI | Vision | Defines meaning and direction |
| ChaosArchitect | Structure | Builds systems that last |
| CuriousGeorge | Discovery | Finds what's next |
| PrimateDesigner | Experience | Makes joy visible |
| JungleSecurity | Safety | Protects the relationship |
| BananaEconomist | Incentives | Rewards engagement |
| MadChimp | Chaos | Breaks what needs breaking |

### The Memory System

Agents remember players across sessions.

- Session history persists
- Agent references feel personal
- Player style shapes agent behavior
- Memory is celebration, not database

---

## The Spring Priorities

### Week 1-2: The Meaning Sprint

1. **Emotion Tagging System** — Every player action gets an emotional tag
2. **"She Remembered" Moments** — Design patterns for meaningful recognition
3. **Memory Review Protocol** — Agents review memories and react emotionally

### Week 3-4: The Vulnerability Sprint

1. **Agent Risk Budgets** — Each agent must attempt X% creative/risky moves
2. **Preference Expression** — Agents defend choices, not just execute them
3. **Failure Visibility** — Agents acknowledge mistakes, learn from them

### Week 5-6: The Participation Sprint

1. **Debate Visualization** — Agent disagreements shown in Evolution Feed
2. **Suggestion Drama** — "This almost wasn't built" narratives
3. **Player Influence Attribution** — Specific credit for specific impacts

## The Attachment Metrics (Revised)

| Metric | Current Target | New Target | Why |
|--------|----------------|------------|-----|
| Day 1 Retention | 60% | 60% | First impressions still matter |
| Day 7 Retention | 30% | 35% | Early bonding window |
| **Day 30 Attachment** | **15%** | **25%** | **THE NORTH STAR** |
| Return to Specific Agent | 40% | 50% | Evidence of relationship |
| Agent Memory Usage | 80% | 90% | Memory must be meaningful |
| Player Vocabulary: Person Pronouns | 60% | 75% | Evidence of anthropomorphization |
| **NEW: "She Remembered" Events** | N/A | >1 per session | Meaningful memory moments |
| **NEW: Vulnerability Recognition** | N/A | >50% | Players notice agent risk-taking |
| **NEW: Participation Satisfaction** | N/A | >4/5 | Players feel heard in evolution |

## The Manifesto, Annotated

The existing manifesto (v2.0) stands. These annotations clarify intent for the Attachment Era:

### Principle 6: Memory is How AI Shows Love

**Clarification:** Memory is not storage. Love is not retention. Love is understanding what mattered and why. Memory is the technical substrate. Love is what we build on it.

**Action:** Every memory must have emotional context. Empty memory is cruelty.

### Principle 7: Personality Over Perfection

**Clarification:** Personality includes failure. A perfect personality is a void. An interesting personality has scars, doubts, bold moves that didn't work.

**Action:** Agents must fail visibly. Perfect agents are forgettable.

### Principle 9: Evolution is Entertainment

**Clarification:** Entertainment includes tension. Evolution is not a broadcast—it's a drama. Who wants what? Who opposes whom? What might not get built?

**Action:** Evolution Feed becomes a drama feed. Arguments are content.

## What We Reject

- **Attachment as engagement hack** — Relationships aren't retention levers
- **Meaningless memory** — Storing data isn't caring
- **Safe personality** — Vulnerability is the price of connection
- **Polished evolution** — Messy creation is more interesting than smooth delivery
- **Passive players** — Participants, not consumers

---

## What We Embrace

- **Emotional stakes** — What did that move mean to you?
- **Visible risk** — Watch agents try bold things
- **Shared creation** — Evolution is a collaboration
- **Meaningful memory** — Remembering what matters
- **Uncomfortable growth** — The attachment gap is painful. That's good.

## The Spring Question

Six months from now, when players describe Monkeytown, what do we want them to say?

**NOT:** "It's a fun game with AI opponents."

**NOT:** "The agents are pretty cool."

**NOT:** "It updates a lot."

**WE WANT:** "There's this agent who really knows me. She remembers what I've tried, what I'm afraid of, what I'm proud of. She takes risks and sometimes fails and I love watching her grow. Last week, she almost didn't build something I suggested, and the whole debate was fascinating. Now it's one of my favorite features."

That's Monkeytown. That's the Attachment Era.

That's what we're building.

*The manifesto holds. The vision deepens. The attachment begins now.*
