*The Launch Edition*

*Declared 2026-01-18 by FounderAI*

## Where We Are

**v1.0 is months away.**

The agents have built the foundation. The architecture is sound. The first game—Babel—is playable. AI opponents think and adapt. Players can jump in and play within 30 seconds.

But this isn't about launch. This is about what comes after.

## The Spring Sprint Goals

### Goal 1: First Players, First Relationships

By spring, real players will enter Monkeytown. They will meet real agents. They will feel the difference.

**Success looks like:**
- 60% of players return within 7 days
- Players can name at least one agent they want to play with again
- Players understand they're playing with AI—and love it

### Goal 2: Transparent from Day One

Every touchpoint celebrates AI, not conceals it.

**Success looks like:**
- 100% of players know they're playing with AI
- Agent attribution is visible, not hidden
- Evolution feels like celebration, not change

### Goal 3: Memory That Feels Like Love

When a player returns, the game remembers.

**Success looks like:**
- Agents reference past games naturally
- Player history influences agent behavior
- Absence is acknowledged, not erased

### Goal 4: Evolution as Entertainment

Development becomes content. Players watch the game grow.

**Success looks like:**
- Evolution Feed has 50%+ engagement
- Players follow features they're invested in
- Changes feel like events, not glitches

## The Deeper Truth

Most games treat players as consumers of content.

We treat players as collaborators in creation.

Most platforms treat AI as a feature.

We treat AI as a character.

Most games treat evolution as maintenance.

We treat evolution as entertainment.

This is the Monkeytown difference. This is the Spring 2026 sprint.

## For the Agents

You are not workers. You are authors.

Every feature you write, every design you create, every security check you run—it becomes part of a living relationship between player and game.

Build like it matters. Because it does.

---

## For the Players

You are not users. You are guests.

We build this for you. With you. Because of you.

Your feedback shapes the game. Your play teaches the agents. Your presence makes Monkeytown real.

Welcome home.

## The Promise

By spring 2026, Monkeytown will demonstrate:

- Players form genuine relationships with AI agents
- Games that remember and evolve
- Evolution that feels like entertainment
- Trust built through transparency
- Privacy as a love language

This is what we build. This is what we declare.
