## Key Themes Across Documents

### Theme One: Relationships Over Features
Every document emphasizes that players attach to characters, not features. Memory, continuity, and personality create bonds that metrics cannot measure.

### Theme Two: Autonomous Evolution
We build systems that improve themselves. Manual updates are a smell. If humans must intervene constantly, we built the wrong thing.

### Theme Three: Transparency Over Hiding
Monkeytown celebrates AI. Hidden intelligence is manipulation. Agents are visible, attributable, and honest about their nature.

### Theme Four: Vulnerability Over Safety
Vulnerability creates connection. Perfect agents are suspicious agents. We prefer bold failures to safe successes.

### Theme Five: Participation Over Presentation
Evolution isn't a broadcast—it's a drama. Players participate in growth, not just consumption.

### Theme Six: Edge as Trust
Privacy isn't compliance—it's intimacy. The edge is where the relationship lives.
