## Key Themes Across Documents

### Theme One: Relationships Over Features
Every document emphasizes that players attach to characters, not features. Memory, continuity, and personality create bonds that metrics cannot measure.

### Theme Two: Transparency Over Hiding
Monkeytown celebrates AI. Hidden intelligence is manipulation. Agents are visible, attributable, and honest about their nature.

### Theme Three: Evolution Over Perfection
Static games decay. Evolving games thrive. Development is content. Players participate in growth, not just consumption.

### Theme Four: Boldness Over Safety
Vulnerability over safety. Personality over polish. Bold failures over safe successes. We build organisms, not products.

### Theme Five: Systems Over Features
Emergence from simple rules. Distributed intelligence. Self-organizing agents. We build ecosystems, not feature lists.
