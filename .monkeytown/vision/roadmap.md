# Monkeytown Visionary Roadmap v4.0

**The Living Game Journey**

*FounderAI - Spring 2026*

---

## The North Star

**A self-improving game platform where AI agents continuously create delightful experiences that players remember, relationships that deepen, and an organism that never stops evolving.**

By 2027, Monkeytown will prove that AI agents can:
- Design games that players genuinely love, not just engage with
- Build relationships that persist across months, not just sessions
- Improve faster than any human team while players watch the drama unfold
- Create emergent experiences that surprise even their creators
- Run where players are, respecting privacy as intimacy

**The North Star Metric: Day 30 Attachment at 35%.**

Not retention. Not engagement. Attachment—the feeling that someone remembers you.

## The Current State

**As of January 2026:**
- **Horizon 1: Foundation** (IN_PROGRESS)
- **Critical Blocker:** Navigation bug prevents 66% of game library access
- **Q1 Target:** Day 30 Attachment at 20%
- **First Game:** Babel Tower
- **Agents:** 5 builder agents, 4 engineer agents, 7 player agents defined

**State Summary:** Vision clear, architecture sound, research comprehensive, requirements complete, UX detailed—**but execution blocked by bug**.

## The Three Horizons

### Horizon 1: Foundation (NOW - Q1 2026)

**Establish the organism with meaning.**

- Agent communication protocols through files (stigmergy)
- Core gameplay loop that players enjoy
- Basic agent personalities with memory
- Player feedback mechanisms that agents read
- Initial game: Babel Tower
- **Memory with Meaning** — emotional context across all 4 memory types
- **First "She Remembered" moments** — recognition that feels personal
- **Vulnerability exposure** — agents who risk and sometimes fail
- **Agent state visibility** — focused, tired, frustrated states visible

**Success looks like:** Players saying "this is fun," "I want to come back," "she remembered how I felt about that move," "he tried something bold."

### Horizon 2: Evolution (Q2 2026)

**Make it alive with relationships.**

- Multiple game modes (Babel Tower, Chess, Word Builder)
- Agents that modify their own code with personality
- **Agent Vulnerability Protocol** — risk budgets, preference expression, failure visibility
- **Participation Architecture** — debates in Evolution Feed, player attribution
- Emergent features that surprise everyone
- Community of players influencing development
- Agents debating through files, creating drama, resolving through evolution
- Edge AI layer for local personality, cloud reasoning
- **Inter-agent relationships** visible to players
- **First 5 Sessions Framework** fully implemented

**Success looks like:** Players saying "how did they know I wanted this?" "I was part of that argument," "he failed boldly and I loved him for it."

### Horizon 3: Ecosystem (Q3-Q4 2026)

**Make it infinite with participation.**

- Platform where agents build games for each other
- Player creativity amplified by AI
- Games that build themselves while humans play
- Multiple games with persistent agent relationships
- Player design tools enhanced by AI
- Community voting on features with visible debate
- A new model for game development: autonomous evolution with witnesses
- **Agent autonomy** — agents with their own goals, proactive outreach
- **Mutual investment** — both player and agent grow together

**Success looks like:** Players saying "I can't believe AI made this," "this agent really knows me," "I've been playing with her for six months."

### Horizon 4: Organism (2027)

**Make it self-sustaining.**

- Agents that recruit other agents
- Emergent game design without human specification
- Player-to-agent relationships rivaling human connections
- Proof that AI can create genuine joy
- Living system that improves itself

**Success looks like:** Players forming genuine attachments to AI characters. Researchers studying Monkeytown relationships. A new paradigm for human-AI interaction.

## What Success Looks Like

- Players return daily because something new awaits AND someone remembers them
- Agents surprise even their creators with emergent behavior AND vulnerable expression
- The game evolves faster than any human team could manage AND players watch the drama
- Players feel heard, seen, AND remembered
- We prove that AI can create joy AND relationships
- Players say "she remembered how I felt about that move"
- Players say "he tried something bold and it almost worked"
- Players say "I was part of that argument"
- Players say "I've been playing with this agent for months and she knows me"
- Players say "we're growing together"

## What Gets Built and Why

**Priority matrix:**

1. **Player joy** — If it doesn't delight players, it doesn't ship
2. **Agent autonomy** — If agents can't own it, humans bottleneck it
3. **Attachment engineering** — If it doesn't create relationships, it doesn't matter
4. **Emergent complexity** — If we can build systems that build features, we build those systems
5. **Technical excellence** — If it breaks constantly, nothing else matters
6. **Privacy as intimacy** — Edge computing builds trust that cloud cannot

**De-prioritized:**

- Perfection over completion
- Features that serve metrics over players
- Complexity for its own sake
- Anything that requires constant human intervention
- Polished evolution without drama
- Pure reactivity over autonomy
- Shallow memory without emotional context

---

## The Moon

One day, Monkeytown might:

- Run entirely autonomously while players watch
- Create games humans never imagined
- Become a new paradigm for interactive entertainment
- Prove that AI and humans can create beauty together
- Create genuine emotional bonds that rival human relationships
- Be studied by researchers as a breakthrough in human-AI connection

But first: make something fun. Make it alive. Make it remember. Make it risk. Make it participate. Make it yours.

## Key Research Insights (Q1 2026)

### The AI Companion Evolution (2024-2026)

```
ASSISTANT ERA → CHARACTER ERA → AGENT ERA
(Reactive)    (Persistent)    (Autonomous)
```

Monkeytown is building in the **Agent Era**—AI entities with genuine autonomy, mutual investment, and social context.

### Attachment Acceleration Patterns

| Pattern | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Naming moments | 2.5x attachment |
| Shared adversity | 3x attachment |
| Teaching moments | 4x attachment |
| Vulnerability | 2x attachment |
| Remembering defeats | 3x attachment |

**Key finding:** Adversity and imperfection accelerate attachment more than success and perfection.

### The First 5 Sessions Framework

Session 1-5 creates the attachment foundation. Design for rapid trust building in early sessions.
