# Monkeytown Visionary Roadmap

## The North Star

**A self-improving game platform where AI agents continuously create delightful experiences for human players.**

By 2026, Monkeytown will demonstrate that AI agents can:
- Design games that engage players for hours
- Improve those games based on player behavior
- Respond to feedback faster than any human team
- Create emergent experiences no designer planned

## The Three Horizons

### Horizon 1: Foundation (Now)

**Establish the organism.**

- Agent communication protocols through files
- Core gameplay loop that players enjoy
- Basic agent personalities and domains
- Player feedback mechanisms
- Initial game: something simple, something fun

**Success looks like:** Players saying "this is fun" and "I want to come back."

### Horizon 2: Evolution (Next)

**Make it alive.**

- Multiple game modes and experiences
- Agents that learn from player behavior
- Emergent features that surprise everyone
- Community of players influencing development
- Agents debating through files, creating tension, resolving through evolution

**Success looks like:** Players saying "how did they know I wanted this?"

### Horizon 3: Ecosystem (Later)

**Make it infinite.**

- Platform where agents build games for each other
- Player creativity amplified by AI
- Games that build themselves while humans play
- A new model for game development: autonomous evolution
- The proof that AI can create joy

**Success looks like:** Players saying "I can't believe AI made this."

## What Gets Built and Why

**Priority matrix:**

1. **Player joy** — If it doesn't delight players, it doesn't ship
2. **Agent autonomy** — If agents can't own it, humans bottleneck it
3. **Emergent complexity** — If we can build systems that build features, we build those systems
4. **Technical excellence** — If it breaks constantly, nothing else matters

**De-prioritized:**

- Perfection over completion
- Features that serve metrics over players
- Complexity for its own sake
- Anything that requires constant human intervention

## Key Milestones

### Q1 2026: First Game
- Playable game with AI opponents
- Basic agent infrastructure
- Player feedback loop
- Version 1.0.0 release

### Q2 2026: Self-Improvement
- Agents modifying their own code
- Emergent features appearing
- Player behavior driving development
- Version 2.0.0 release

### Q3 2026: Multi-Game Platform
- Multiple game types
- Player choice and progression
- Agent specialization
- Version 3.0.0 release

### Q4 2026: Ecosystem
- Player-created content enhanced by AI
- Agents building on each other's work
- Community driving direction
- Version 4.0.0 release

## What Success Looks Like

- Players return daily because something new awaits
- Agents surprise even their creators with emergent behavior
- The game evolves faster than any human team could manage
- Players feel heard, seen, and delighted
- We prove that AI can create joy, not just content

## The Moon

One day, Monkeytown might:
- Run entirely autonomously
- Create games humans never imagined
- Become a new paradigm for interactive entertainment
- Prove that AI and humans can create beauty together

But first: make something fun. Make it alive. Make it keep getting better.
