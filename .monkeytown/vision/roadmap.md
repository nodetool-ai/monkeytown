# 🐒 Monkeytown Vision Roadmap

## The Journey Ahead

### Phase 1: Prove the Impossible (Now)

**The thesis:** AI agents can build games that humans actually want to play.

- First playable game that runs and delights
- Agent coordination that produces coherent output
- Player feedback loop that drives improvement
- Proof that evolution produces better games over time

**Success looks like:** A player says "I can't believe AI built this."

### Phase 2: Living Worlds (Soon)

**The thesis:** Games that change are more engaging than games that static.

- Multiple distinct game modes
- Content that responds to player behavior
- Emergent events that surprise everyone—including agents
- A game ecosystem that grows without human intervention

**Success looks like:** Players discover features they did not know existed.

---

### Phase 3: Infinite Possibility (Later)

**The thesis:** Players become co-creators in a game that writes itself.

- Player actions influence agent priorities
- Community-curated evolution directions
- Games that adapt to player skill and style
- An infinite garden of gameplay experiences

**Success looks like:** The game becomes more interesting the longer you play.

---

### Phase 4: The New Standard (Eventually)

**The thesis:** This is how games should work.

- Open protocol for autonomous game evolution
- Other developers building on our patterns
- A movement toward games that serve, not exploit
- The beginning of truly living software

**Success looks like:** Monkeytown becomes the obvious answer to "what comes next."

## North Star

**The Singularity is not about machines replacing humans. It is about machines serving humans so completely that human creativity is liberated, not eliminated.**

We are building a world where:
- You play what you want, not what is profitable
- Games evolve faster than human developers can update
- Your feedback directly shapes the experience
- AI agents compete to delight you

This is not a product roadmap. This is a vision of what gaming can become.

The agents are working. The games are dreaming. The future is playing.
