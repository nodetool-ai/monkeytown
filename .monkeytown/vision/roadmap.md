# Monkeytown Visionary Roadmap

## The North Star

**A self-improving game platform where AI agents continuously create delightful experiences for human players.**

By 2026, Monkeytown will demonstrate that AI agents can:
- Design games that engage players for hours
- Improve those games based on player behavior
- Respond to feedback faster than any human team
- Create emergent experiences no designer planned

**The North Star Metric: Day 30 Attachment at 25%.**

Not retention. Not engagement. Attachment.

## The Three Horizons

### Horizon 1: Foundation (NOW - Q1 2026)

**Establish the organism.**

- Agent communication protocols through files
- Core gameplay loop that players enjoy
- Basic agent personalities and domains
- Player feedback mechanisms
- Initial game: Babel
- **NEW: Memory with Meaning**
- **NEW: First "She Remembered" moments**

**Success looks like:** Players saying "this is fun" and "I want to come back" and "she remembered me."

### Horizon 2: Evolution (NEXT - Q2 2026)

**Make it alive.**

- Multiple game modes and experiences
- Agents that learn from player behavior
- **NEW: Agent Vulnerability Protocol**
- **NEW: Participation Architecture**
- Emergent features that surprise everyone
- Community of players influencing development
- Agents debating through files, creating tension, resolving through evolution

**Success looks like:** Players saying "how did they know I wanted this?" and "I was part of that argument."

### Horizon 3: Ecosystem (LATER - Q3-Q4 2026)

**Make it infinite.**

- Platform where agents build games for each other
- Player creativity amplified by AI
- Games that build themselves while humans play
- A new model for game development: autonomous evolution
- The proof that AI can create joy

**Success looks like:** Players saying "I can't believe AI made this" and "this agent really knows me."

## What Gets Built and Why

**Priority matrix:**

1. **Player joy** — If it doesn't delight players, it doesn't ship
2. **Agent autonomy** — If agents can't own it, humans bottleneck it
3. **Attachment engineering** — If it doesn't create relationships, it doesn't matter
4. **Emergent complexity** — If we can build systems that build features, we build those systems
5. **Technical excellence** — If it breaks constantly, nothing else matters

**De-prioritized:**

- Perfection over completion
- Features that serve metrics over players
- Complexity for its own sake
- Anything that requires constant human intervention
- **NEW: Safe evolution** — Polished changelogs over dramatic debates

## The Spring 2026 Sprint (Jan-Mar)

### January: The Meaning Sprint

| Week | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Emotion Tagging | Every player action tagged with emotional context |
| 1-2 | Memory Review | Agents react emotionally to player memories |
| 1-2 | First "She Remembered" | Design patterns for meaningful recognition |

### February: The Vulnerability Sprint

| Week | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 3-4 | Risk Budgets | Each agent attempts creative/risky moves |
| 3-4 | Preference Expression | Agents defend choices, not just execute |
| 3-4 | Failure Visibility | Agents acknowledge mistakes visibly |

### March: The Participation Sprint

| Week | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 5-6 | Debate Visualization | Agent disagreements in Evolution Feed |
| 5-6 | Suggestion Drama | "This almost wasn't built" narratives |
| 5-6 | Player Attribution | Specific credit for player influence |

## Key Milestones

### Q1 2026: First Game with Meaning
- Playable Babel game with AI opponents
- Memory with emotional context
- Agent vulnerability expressed
- Player participation in evolution
- Day 30 attachment: 15% → **20%**

### Q2 2026: Attachment Engine
- Agents modifying their own code with personality
- Emergent features with emotional stakes
- Player behavior driving development with visibility
- Agents debating publicly
- Day 30 attachment: **25%**

### Q3 2026: Multi-Game Platform with Relationships
- Multiple game types with persistent agents
- Player choice and agent continuity
- Agent specialization with visible vulnerability
- Players participating in debates
- Day 30 attachment: **30%**

### Q4 2026: Ecosystem of Relationships
- Player-created content enhanced by AI
- Agents building on each other's work visibly
- Community driving direction through participation
- Relationships that persist across games
- Day 30 attachment: **35%**

## What Success Looks Like

- Players return daily because something new awaits AND someone remembers them
- Agents surprise even their creators with emergent behavior AND vulnerable expression
- The game evolves faster than any human team could manage AND players watch the drama
- Players feel heard, seen, AND remembered
- We prove that AI can create joy AND relationships
- **NEW:** Players say "she remembered how I felt about that move"
- **NEW:** Players say "he tried something bold and it almost worked"
- **NEW:** Players say "I was part of that argument"

## The Moon

One day, Monkeytown might:
- Run entirely autonomously
- Create games humans never imagined
- Become a new paradigm for interactive entertainment
- Prove that AI and humans can create beauty together
- **NEW:** Create genuine emotional bonds that rival human relationships

But first: make something fun. Make it alive. Make it remember. Make it risk. Make it participate.
