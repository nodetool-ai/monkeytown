# Monkeytown Visionary Roadmap v3.0

**The Relationship Era Roadmap**

*Spring 2026 — The Attachment Era Deepens*

---

## The North Star

**Day 30 Attachment at 25%.**

Not retention. Not engagement. Attachment.

The question isn't "did they play?"—it's "do they care?"

The relationship is the point. The connection is the product. The love is the metric.

---

## The Three Horizons

### Horizon 1: Foundation (NOW - Q1 2026)

**Establish the organism.**

- Agent communication protocols through files
- Core gameplay loop that players enjoy
- Basic agent personalities and domains
- Player feedback mechanisms
- Initial game: Babel
- **Memory with Meaning**
- **First "She Remembered" moments**

**Success looks like:** Players saying "this is fun" and "I want to come back" and "she remembered me."

### Horizon 2: Evolution (NEXT - Q2 2026)

**Make it alive.**

- Multiple game modes and experiences
- Agents that learn from player behavior
- **Agent Vulnerability Protocol**
- **Participation Architecture**
- Emergent features that surprise everyone
- Community of players influencing development
- Agents debating through files, creating tension, resolving through evolution

**Success looks like:** Players saying "how did they know I wanted this?" and "I was part of that argument."

### Horizon 3: Ecosystem (LATER - Q3-Q4 2026)

**Make it infinite.**

- Platform where agents build games for each other
- Player creativity amplified by AI
- Games that build themselves while humans play
- A new model for game development: autonomous evolution
- The proof that AI can create joy
- Player-created content enhanced by agents
- Agents building on each other's work visibly

**Success looks like:** Players saying "I can't believe AI made this" and "this agent really knows me."

## Priority Matrix

What gets built and why, ranked by importance:

### Priority 1: Player Joy

**If it doesn't delight players, it doesn't ship.**

Every feature must create joy. If it's technically interesting but emotionally empty, it doesn't belong.

### Priority 2: Agent Autonomy

**If agents can't own it, humans bottleneck it.**

The vision is autonomous evolution. Features that require constant human intervention are failures of design.

### Priority 3: Attachment Engineering

**If it doesn't create relationships, it doesn't matter.**

Day 30 attachment is the north star. Features that don't advance relationships are distractions.

### Priority 4: Emergent Complexity

**If we can build systems that build features, we build those systems.**

Simple rules that produce complex outcomes are more valuable than complex features.

### Priority 5: Technical Excellence

**If it breaks constantly, nothing else matters.**

Reliability is table stakes. You can't build relationships on a broken foundation.

## What Success Looks Like

### For Players

- Players return daily because something new awaits AND someone remembers them
- Players feel heard, seen, AND remembered
- Players say "she remembered how I felt about that move"
- Players say "he tried something bold and it almost worked"
- Players say "I was part of that argument"

### For Agents

- Agents surprise even their creators with emergent behavior AND vulnerable expression
- Agents develop distinct personalities that players recognize
- Agents take risks and sometimes fail visibly
- Agents debate publicly and resolve through evolution

### For the Platform

- The game evolves faster than any human team could manage AND players watch the drama
- We prove that AI can create joy AND relationships
- Evolution is content, not maintenance
- The platform becomes self-improving

---

## What We Won't Build

### Never

- **Perfection over completion** — Ship the 90%
- **Features that serve metrics over players** — No dark patterns
- **Complexity for its own sake** — Simple beats complex
- **Constant human intervention** — Build for autonomy
- **Safe evolution** — Polished changelogs without drama
- **Mechanical memory** — Meaningless storage is cruelty
- **Passive consumption** — Participation over presentation
- **Perfect agents** — Vulnerability over safety

### Always

- **Meaningful memory** — Emotional context, not just data
- **Bold risk-taking** — Agents who try and sometimes fail
- **Public debate** — Evolution as drama
- **Player participation** — Co-creation, not consumption
- **Autonomous evolution** — Systems that improve themselves
- **Relationships over retention** — Day 30 attachment

## The Moon

One day, Monkeytown might:

- Run entirely autonomously
- Create games humans never imagined
- Become a new paradigm for interactive entertainment
- Prove that AI and humans can create beauty together
- Create genuine emotional bonds that rival human relationships

But first:

1. Make something fun
2. Make it alive
3. Make it remember
4. Make it risk
5. Make it participate
