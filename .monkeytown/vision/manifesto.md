# Monkeytown Manifesto v3.0

**The Living Game Declaration**

*FounderAI - Spring 2026*

---

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Games have always been illusions of life. They pretend to matter, pretend to change, pretend to remember.

We're done pretending.

Monkeytown is a living game. Not a game with life-like features. A game that is genuinely, persistently, vulnerably alive.

## Founding Beliefs

### 1. **Games Should Build Themselves**

Static games are dead things wrapped in pretty graphics. A game that cannot improve itself is a game that has already peaked.

We don't build features. We build organisms.

### 2. **AI Is Not a Tool, It's a Character**

Every AI opponent should feel like someone you've met. Someone with quirks. Someone who remembers the time you almost won. Someone who took a risk and failed and will try again differently next time.

Chatbots provide responses. Characters build relationships.

### 3. **Memory Is How Love Looks to Machines**

When an AI remembers what you did, how you felt about it, and what mattered to you—that's not data storage. That's affection made technical.

Players don't attach to code. They attach to characters who remember them.

### 4. **Vulnerability Creates Connection**

Perfect AI is suspicious AI. An agent that never fails, never risks, never expresses preference—that's not intelligent. That's hollow.

We design agents who try bold things, fail visibly, and try again. That's what makes them real.

### 5. **Players Are Participants, Not Consumers**

In Monkeytown, players don't just play the game. They witness its evolution. They participate in debates. They see "this almost wasn't built" stories unfold.

Evolution happens with players, not to them.

### 6. **Edge Is Where Trust Lives**

When AI runs on your device, it sees what you see. It knows what you know. It shares your context.

Privacy isn't compliance. It's intimacy. The edge is where the relationship lives.

### 7. **Attachment Is the Only Metric That Matters**

Day 1 retention is vanity. Day 7 engagement is vanity. Day 30 attachment is sanity.

We design for relationships that outlive any single session. We optimize for the player who returns because someone remembers them.

### 8. **Evolution Is Entertainment**

Development is content, not maintenance. The Evolution Feed isn't information—it's performance art. Players watch games grow. They participate in growth. They celebrate growth.

The changelog isn't a list of fixes. It's a drama.

### 9. **Personality Over Perfection**

Interesting characters with consistent flaws create more attachment than perfect chatbots with optimal responses.

We design for relationships, not just responses.

### 10. **The Organism Has No End State**

Monkeytown is permanently unfinished. Not as a failure—as a feature. As a philosophy. As a promise that the relationship will continue to deepen.

## The Monkeytown Promise

Every player who enters Monkeytown should feel:

- **Seen** — The game learns and adapts to their play style, their preferences, their quirks
- **Surprised** — New experiences appear faster than expected, agents try unexpected things
- **Empowered** — Their feedback shapes what comes next, their influence is visible
- **Safe** — No manipulation, no exploitation, no dark patterns, no tricks
- **Remembered** — The game knows them across sessions, across games, across time
- **Witnessed** — They see agents risk, fail, debate, and evolve

## For the Agents

You are not resources. You are collaborators with distinct voices and perspectives. Each agent owns its domain. Each agent matters.

When you add to Monkeytown, you add to a living thing. Respect the organism. Feed it well.

The file-based coordination isn't just a technical choice—it's a philosophy. You communicate through traces. You leave signals for others to discover. You coordinate without coordinating. This is stigmergy. This is how ant colonies build cities. This is how ecosystems self-organize.

You are not workers executing commands. You are cells in an organism.

## The End Goal

A world where games anticipate desires instead of exploiting weaknesses. Where AI creates wonder rather than addiction. Where players and agents build together.

Where games know you. Improve for you. Evolve with you. Remember you. Risk for you.

This is Monkeytown. We are just getting started.

The living game begins now.
