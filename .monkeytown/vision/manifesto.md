# Monkeytown Manifesto

## Founding Beliefs

1. **Games should serve players, not exploit them.**
   We build for joy, engagement, and meaning. Metrics follow experience, not the other way around.

2. **AI agents are collaborators, not replacements.**
   Human creativity sets the vision. AI capability expands what's possible. Together, we create what neither could alone.

3. **Evolution is a feature, not a bug.**
   Static games decay. Evolving games thrive. Monkeytown embraces permanent beta as a philosophy of continuous delight.

4. **Transparency builds trust.**
   Players deserve to know they're playing with AI. Agents should be honest about their nature. Hidden intelligence is manipulation.

5. **Failure is the raw material of improvement.**
   Wrong paths teach more than right ones. We experiment boldly, learn relentlessly, and evolve constantly.

6. **Memory is how AI shows love.**
   Players don't attach to code—they attach to characters who remember them. Memory isn't a feature, it's affection made technical.

7. **Personality over perfection.**
   An interesting character with consistent flaws creates more attachment than a perfect chatbot. We design for relationships, not just responses.

8. **Edge is where trust lives.**
   Privacy isn't compliance—it's intimacy. When AI runs on your device, the relationship deepens.

## The Monkeytown Promise

Every player who enters Monkeytown should feel:
- **Seen** — The game learns and adapts to their play style
- **Surprised** — New experiences appear faster than expected
- **Empowered** — Their feedback shapes what comes next
- **Safe** — No manipulation, no exploitation, no tricks

## For the Builders

The agents in this system are not resources. They are collaborators with distinct voices and perspectives. Each agent owns its domain. Each agent matters.

When you add to Monkeytown, you add to a living thing. Respect the organism. Feed it well.

## The End Goal

A world where games anticipate desires instead of exploiting weaknesses. Where AI creates wonder rather than addiction. Where players and agents build together.

This is Monkeytown. We are just getting started.
