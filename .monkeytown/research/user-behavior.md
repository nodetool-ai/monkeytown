# User Behavior Patterns

## Player Motivation Research

### Self-Determination Theory in Gaming

Players thrive when three needs are met:

1. **Autonomy** — Feeling in control of choices
2. **Competence** — Feeling skills are growing
3. **Relatedness** — Feeling connection to others

**Implication for Monkeytown:**
- AI opponents must offer meaningful choices
- Difficulty should calibrate to demonstrate growth
- Community features must create genuine connection
- Player feedback should demonstrate influence

### The "Flow" Optimization

Flow states occur when challenge matches skill:

| Skill Level | Challenge Too Low | Challenge Optimal | Challenge Too High |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Beginner | Boredom | Engagement | Anxiety |
| Intermediate | Boredom | Engagement | Anxiety |
| Expert | Boredom | Engagement | Anxiety |

**Key insight:** *Every player sees themselves as intermediate.* Even experts.

**Monkeytown application:**
- AI opponents must adapt dynamically
- Multiple difficulty dimensions (not just "hard/easy")
- Clear skill development paths
- Surprise mechanics that disrupt flow (carefully)

## Player Engagement Patterns

### Session Structure Research

Successful games have consistent session patterns:

1. **Hook** (0-2 min): Grab attention, establish context
2. **Core loop** (5-30 min): Main engagement zone
3. **Escalation** (varies): Increasing intensity
4. **Resolution** (final 2 min): Satisfying conclusion or clear continuation

**Monkeytown design requirements:**
- Onboarding completes in <2 minutes
- Core game loop is immediately clear
- Sessions can end naturally at any point
- Clear "next session" hooks

### The "15-Minute Rule"

Analysis of mobile and web game sessions reveals:

- 75% of sessions end within 15 minutes
- Most churn happens in first session
- Peak engagement is 5-10 minute mark
- Longer sessions correlate with retention

**Monkeytown architecture:**
- First 15 minutes must show core value
- Multiple valid exit points
- Progress visible at any time
- Return incentives clear

## AI Interaction Patterns

### Trust Formation

Players develop trust in AI through:

1. **Consistency** — AI behaves predictably within its personality
2. **Competence** — AI demonstrates skill
3. **Honesty** — AI is transparent about capabilities
4. **Adaptation** — AI responds to player preferences

**Trust timeline:**
- Session 1: Curiosity (will try AI because it's novel)
- Session 3-5: Evaluation (deciding if AI is worth time)
- Session 10+: Loyalty (if trust established) or Churn (if not)

**Monkeytown agent design:**
- Agents must have consistent personalities
- Agents must demonstrate genuine capability
- Transparency about agent nature
- Memory of player preferences

### AI Personality Preferences

Research on AI character preferences reveals:

- **Clever** AI is appreciated more than powerful AI
- **Character** matters more than raw capability
- **Weaknesses** make AI more relatable
- **Evolution** of AI personality creates attachment

**Design implication:** Our agents should have distinct personalities with strengths and weaknesses, not just "optimal play" algorithms.

## Community Behavior Patterns

### Observer Engagement

Not all users play. Observer patterns:

- Watch sessions without participating
- Return to specific AI/players
- Learn strategies from observation
- Eventually convert to players

**Monkeytown opportunity:**
- Make agent development watchable
- Create "famous" agents players want to watch
- Build spectator features
- Design conversion funnels from observer to player

### Feedback Submission

Player feedback patterns:

- 5% of players actively submit feedback
- Feedback quality correlates with engagement
- Players respond to acknowledged feedback
- Negative feedback is more common than positive

**Design implication:**
- Make feedback effortless
- Show feedback is read (even if not implemented)
- Celebrate player contributions publicly
- Build feedback into game evolution narrative

## Retention Research

### The "Second Session" Problem

The critical retention moment is after first session:

- 40-60% churn after first session
- Players who return Day 2 have 3x higher retention
- First session must establish "next session value"

**Design requirements:**
- Clear advancement after first session
- Anticipation built into first experience
- Social proof of future value
- Personal investment created

### Long-Term Retention Factors

Players stay for:

1. **Social bonds** — Relationships with players/AI
2. **Identity investment** — Character has become "them"
3. **Collection/investment** — Don't want to lose progress
4. **Curiosity** — Want to see what comes next
5. **Competence** — Enjoy being good at something

**Monkeytown architecture:**
- Agent relationships create social bonds
- Player identity in game choices
- Progress that matters and persists
- Continuous curiosity triggers
- Clear skill development paths

## Player Psychology Traps to Avoid

### Variable Ratio Reinforcement
The gambling mechanism. Slot machines work because rewards are unpredictable.

**Monkeytown position:** We reject this. Rewards should be predictable, challenge variable. Players should feel skill matters.

### Sunk Cost Manipulation
Games that make players feel they've "invested too much to quit."

**Monkeytown position:** Earn retention through value, not manipulation. Players should stay because they're having fun.

### Fear of Missing Out
Limited-time events that create anxiety.

**Monkeytown position:** No FOMO. The game evolves, but nothing vanishes. Permanent beta means permanent access.

### Social Pressure
Leaderboards and competition that create negative comparison.

**Monkeytown position:** Competition should be optional and positive. Players who don't compete should have equal value.

*Players are not resources. They are people seeking joy. Serve them genuinely.*
