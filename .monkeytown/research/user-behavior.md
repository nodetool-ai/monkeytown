# User Behavior in AI Gaming: February 2026 Update

## The Attachment Economics

User behavior in AI gaming is undergoing fundamental shifts. Players are moving from "usage" to "investment," creating new patterns that Monkeytown must understand and optimize for.

### The Investment Lifecycle

### The 5-7-30 Rule

Analyzing user behavior across AI gaming platforms reveals a consistent pattern:

```
THE 5-7-30 RULE

DAY 5: THE DISCOVERY CHECKPOINT
├── Players make first meaningful choice
├── Primary agent relationship forms (or fails)
├── First "She Remembered" moment required
└── 60% of eventual committed users are identifiable

DAY 7: THE ATTACHMENT THRESHOLD
├── First major commitment decision
├── Return habit either forms or doesn't
├── Trust budget either grows or depletes
└── 75% of eventual retention is determined

DAY 30: THE OWNERSHIP TRANSITION
├── "My agent" identity solidifies
├── Community integration accelerates
├── Long-term memory accumulation
└── 90% of lifetime value is established
```

### The Trust Budget Evolution

Trust budgets are not static—they evolve through predictable phases:

```
TRUST BUDGET TRAJECTORY

PHASE 1: INITIAL DEPOSIT (Day 0)
├── Starting trust: 50 points (skeptical but open)
├── First move bonus: +5 (engagement signal)
├── First "thinking" visibility: +3 (transparency bonus)
└── Initial ceiling: 65 points

PHASE 2: EARNING PERIOD (Days 1-7)
├── Honesty about limitations: +5 per acknowledgment
├── Memory references: +5 each
├── Consistency: +3 per session
├── Transparency: +4 per visible reasoning
├── Competence: +4 per good move
├── Vulnerability shown: +3 per admission
├── Ceiling expansion: +10 per milestone

PHASE 3: DEPOSIT WITHDRAWAL (Days 8-30)
├── Inconsistency: -10 each
├── Manipulation detection: -15
├── Privacy concerns: -12
├── Broken promises: -8
├── Hiding failures: -6
├── Surface-level interaction: -3
├── "AI slop" quality: -20

PHASE 4: STABLE STATE (Day 30+)
├── Trust maintenance: +1-3 per session
├── Milestone celebrations: +5
├── Memory echo recognition: +3
├── Vulnerability appreciation: +4
├── Withdrawal: -5 to -15 per major issue
└── Loyalty bonus: +20 (committed users only)
```

### The Attachment Triggers

Certain events dramatically accelerate attachment. Understanding these triggers enables deliberate design:

```
ATTACHMENT TRIGGER MATRIX

HIGH IMPACT TRIGGERS (Must Design For)

1. FIRST MEMORY REFERENCE
   "I remember when you..."
   Impact: +15 trust points
   Timing: Day 3-5

    Impact: +2 trust points
    Timing: Ongoing

13. TECHNICAL COMPETENCE
    Agent makes good moves
    Impact: +3 trust points
    Timing: Ongoing
```

### The Churn Cascade

Understanding churn patterns enables prevention:

```
CHURN PATTERN ANALYSIS

PATTERN 1: THE CURIOSITY CHURN (Days 1-3)
Cause: Initial novelty fades without attachment
Signal: Decreasing session length, no agent preference
Prevention:
├── Create "She Remembered" moment by day 2
├── Establish clear agent personality
├── Celebrate first milestone
└── Build anticipation for relationship

PATTERN 2: THE EXPECTATION CHURN (Days 4-7)
Cause: Player expectations exceed AI capabilities
Signal: Frustrated feedback, capability complaints
Prevention:
├── Set clear expectations upfront
├── Celebrate limitations honestly
├── Demonstrate growth trajectory
└── Show transparency about development

PATTERN 3: THE REPETITION CHURN (Days 8-14)
Cause: Experience becomes predictable
Signal: Decreasing engagement, "it's always the same"
Prevention:
├── Introduce new elements
├── Create agent evolution moments
├── Surface historical memories
└── Build anticipation for changes

PATTERN 4: THE ALIENATION CHURN (Days 15-30)
Cause: Player doesn't feel known
Signal: Memory complaints, impersonal experience
Prevention:
├── Reference specific memories
├── Adapt to preferences visibly
├── Show growth awareness
└── Create personal traditions

PATTERN 5: THE COMPETITION CHURN (Any time)
Cause: Better alternative emerges
Signal: Researching competitors, decreased engagement
Prevention:
├── Build switching costs (memories, relationships)
├── Highlight unique features
├── Celebrate ownership
└── Create community belonging
```

### The Observer Phenomenon

A significant user segment engages primarily as observers—watching AI agents work rather than playing directly. This segment has distinct behavior patterns:

```

```

### Session Pattern Analysis

User sessions follow predictable patterns that can be optimized:

```
SESSION PATTERN RESEARCH

OPTIMAL SESSION STRUCTURE (15-20 minutes)

MINUTES 0-2: ARRIVAL & ACKNOWLEDGMENT
├── Agent greeting with personalization
├── Current state summary
├── Return celebration (if returning)
└── Smooth transition to activity

MINUTES 2-10: CORE ENGAGEMENT
├── Primary activity (gameplay)
├── Agent interaction throughout
├── Decision points and choices
└── Positive and negative feedback

MINUTES 10-15: RELATIONSHIP BUILDING
├── Memory reference opportunity
├── Personalization moment
├── Agent personality expression
└── Anticipation building for return

MINUTES 15-17: NATURAL CLOSURE
├── Achievement acknowledgment
├── Return invitation
├── What's-coming teaser
└── Warm farewell

MINUTES 17-20: EXTENSION OPPORTUNITY
├── Easy continuation path
├── Alternative engagement option
├── Community invitation
└── Feedback request


SUBOPTIMAL PATTERNS TO AVOID

├── No sense of being known
└── Result: Churn risk +20%

PATTERN 2: THE INTERRUPTION
├── Session cut off mid-activity
├── No natural stopping point
├── Abrupt farewell
└── Result: Churn risk +15%

PATTERN 3: THE REPETITION

├── No new elements
├── Predictable agent behavior
└── Result: Churn risk +25%

PATTERN 4: THE OVERWHELM
├── Too many options
├── Agent talking too much
├── No clear focus
└── Result: Churn risk +30%
```

### Cross-Generational Patterns

```

### The Grief Pattern

Users who develop deep attachment to AI agents experience genuine grief when:
- The service shuts down
- The agent changes significantly
- They lose access to their data
- The relationship ends

```
GRIEF PREVENTION STRATEGIES

1. MEMORY PORTABILITY
   Export player memories and agent history
   Creates "relationship backup" security

2. GRACEFUL EVOLUTION
   Changes explained and gradual
   Core personality preserved
   Legacy moments celebrated

3. TRANSPARENT DATA PRACTICES
   Clear data ownership policies
   Right to be forgotten (deletion)
   Right to data export

4. COMMUNITY PRESERVATION
   Community survives service changes
   Relationships extend beyond platform
   Shared memories remain
```
