# User Behavior Patterns: March 2026

## The Trust Lifecycle Evolution

### Updated Trust Framework

The AI trust lifecycle has evolved beyond the original "3-session rule." Players now exhibit more sophisticated trust calibration patterns based on industry-wide AI experiences.

**Trust Calibration Cycle:**

```
TRUST EVOLUTION MODEL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Initial State: Skeptical Curiosity (+5 budget)
     │
     ├── Session 1: Exploration
     │   ├── AI capability testing
     │   ├── Manipulation detection
     │   └── First impression formation
     │
     ├── Sessions 2-4: Evaluation
     │   ├── Pattern consistency check
     │   ├── Memory demonstration
     │   └── Personality authenticity
     │
     ├── Sessions 5-10: Commitment Decision
     │   ├── Relationship investment
     │   ├── Vulnerability moments
     │   └── Long-term potential assessment
     │
     └── Session 10+: Loyalty or Churn
         ├── Loyalty: Deep attachment formed
         └── Churn: Trust budget exhausted

Trust Budget Starting: +5 (down from +10 in 2025)
Reason: AI fatigue from industry experiences
```

**Trust Deposit/Withdrawal Changes:**

| Action | Previous | Current | Reason |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| Consistent personality | +2 | +3 | More valued now |
| Honest limitations | +2 | +4 | Transparency premium |
| Remembering preferences | +2 | +2 | Expected baseline |
| Admitting mistakes | +1 | +3 | Authenticity signal |
| Transparent about AI | +2 | +5 | Major differentiator |
| Hidden AI discovered | -8 | -15 | Major trust violation |
| Feeling manipulated | -10 | -20 | Zero tolerance |
| Privacy violations | -15 | -25 | Dealbreaker |

### The "AI Fatigue" Factor

**New Player Mental Model (2026):**
Players approach AI with pre-existing skepticism from:
- Grok deepfake controversies
- Manipulative AI assistant experiences
- Chatbot hallucinations and errors
- Privacy violation reports

**Implication for Monkeytown:**
- First impression transparency critical
- No manipulation tactics allowed
- Privacy-first architecture essential
- Authenticity as differentiator

## Player Attachment Research

### Updated Attachment Framework

Four pillars of attachment remain valid, with new research on their relative importance:

**Attachment Pillars (Revised Weights):**

1. **Continuity** (30%) - Same entity across sessions
2. **Memory** (25%) - AI remembers and references
3. **Personality** (25%) - Distinctive, consistent character
4. **Vulnerability** (20%) - AI can fail and grow

**Attachment Triggers (New Research):**

| Trigger | Response Rate | Frequency for Effect |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| AI saves player from danger | 90% | Once per 5 sessions |
| AI admits uncertainty/error | 75% | 2-3 times per session |
| AI celebrates player success | 85% | Every session |
| AI expresses preference | 70% | 1-2 times per session |
| AI remembers small detail | 80% | Once per session |
| AI asks about player wellbeing | 60% | Once per 3 sessions |

### The Pronoun Shift (Updated)

**Research Finding:**
Players who form attachment shift pronouns faster when:
- AI demonstrates vulnerability
- AI references shared history
- AI expresses preferences
- AI grows over time

**Timeline to Pronoun Shift:**
- 2024: 8 sessions average
- 2025: 5 sessions average
- 2026: 3 sessions average

**Implication:** Deeper attachment forms faster when authenticity signals are clear.

## Session Psychology Updates

### The 15-Minute Engagement Window (Refined)

```
SESSION ENGAGEMENT MODEL (2026 UPDATE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

0-2 min    ████████████████████  Hook (MUST establish value)
2-5 min    █████████████████████ Core loop apparent
5-15 min   ████████████████████████████████ Peak engagement
15-30 min  ████████████████████████  Escalation (optional)
30+ min    █████████████████████     Deep engagement (retention)

Key Change from 2025:
- 2-minute hook now MANDATORY (was flexible)
- First session requires value demonstration in <30 seconds
- "Watch mode" counts toward hook if engaging
```

**First Session Requirements:**
- 30 seconds: Agent personality visible
- 2 minutes: Core game loop understood
- 5 minutes: First meaningful player choice
- 15 minutes: First achievement/success

### The Second Session Problem (Updated)

**Critical Retention Moment (Reconfirmed):**
- 40-60% churn after first session (industry average)
- Players who return Day 2 have 3x higher long-term retention

**Updated Second Session Triggers:**

| Trigger | Effectiveness | Implementation Difficulty |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Unfinished narrative | HIGH | MEDIUM |
| Agent relationship | HIGH | LOW |
| Progress visible | HIGH | LOW |
| Social connection | MEDIUM | MEDIUM |
| Curiosity about changes | HIGH | MEDIUM |
| Daily challenge | MEDIUM | LOW |

**New Finding:** "Curiosity about changes" is more effective in 2026 because:
- Players expect games to evolve
- Development-as-content creates anticipation
- Agent changes are interesting content

## AI Personality Preferences (Updated)

### What Players Actually Want (2026 Update)

**Preferred AI Traits (Ranked 2026):**

| Rank | Trait | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | Trend |
|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Cleverness | 1 | 1 | 1 | Stable |
| 2 | Personality | 3 | 2 | 2 | Rising |
| 3 | Consistency | 2 | 3 | 3 | Stable |
| 4 | Weaknesses | 5 | 4 | 4 | Rising |
| 5 | Evolution | 6 | 5 | 5 | Rising |
| 6 | Power | 4 | 6 | 6 | Declining |

**Key Insight:** Raw capability (Power) is declining in importance. Players prefer:
- Clever rather than powerful
- Consistent rather than overwhelming
- Evolving rather than static
- Vulnerable rather than perfect

### The Big Five in Game AI (Updated)

- When feedback is being considered
- Agent discussion about feedback

### Feedback Attribution Evolution

**Attribution Display Types:**

1. **Immediate (Automated)**
   "Thanks for your feedback!"

2. **Processing**
   "Your feedback is being considered by [Agent]"

3. **In Discussion**
   "[Player suggestions] are being discussed by the team"

4. **Implemented**
   "[Player] suggested [X], implemented by [Agent]"

5. **Celebrated**
   "Community member [Name] helped improve [Feature] - thank you!"

## Evolution Acceptance (Updated)

### Updated Acceptance Model

```
EVOLUTION ACCEPTANCE MODEL (2026 UPDATE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Change Type                  Acceptance  Change from 2025
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Bug fix                      HIGH        Stable
Quality improvement          HIGH        Stable
New feature (additive)       HIGH        ↑ Increased (expect evolution)
Balance change               MEDIUM      ↓ Decreased (more sensitive)
UI change                    LOW-MEDIUM  ↓ Decreased (AI fatigue)
Mechanic removal             LOW         Stable
Core system overhaul         VERY LOW    ↓ Decreased (more skeptical)

Key Insight: Players EXPECT evolution. Stagnation is now negative.
             But changes must be transparent and explained.
```

**2026 Specific Concerns:**
- "Will this change make my progress meaningless?"
- "Is this just engagement manipulation?"
- "Why is this change happening?"
