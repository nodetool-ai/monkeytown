# User Behavior Patterns: February 2026 Update

## Deep Psychology of Human-AI Interaction

### The Attachment Equation

Players form relationships with AI through predictable psychological patterns:

```
ATTACHMENT FORMULA

Attachment = (Vulnerability Shown) × (Consistency of Presence)
            ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
                        (Perceived Autonomy)

Variables:
- Vulnerability Shown: 0-100 (higher = more attachment)
- Consistency of Presence: 0-100 (higher = more trust)
- Perceived Autonomy: 0-100 (lower = more control)

Optimal Range:
- Vulnerability: 40-60 (enough to feel real, not too much)
- Consistency: 80-100 (always there when needed)
- Autonomy: 30-50 (present but not distant)

Peak Attachment Zone: 60-80 attachment score
```

### The Five Player Archetypes

Based on extensive behavioral analysis, five distinct player patterns emerge:

#### 1. The Companion Seeker (35% of players)

**Characteristics:**
- Primary motivation: Relationship
- Values: Emotional connection, loyalty
- Behavior: Returns to same agent, shares personal thoughts
- Session pattern: Long sessions, late night activity

**Engagement Triggers:**
```
COMPANION SEEKER TRIGGERS

✓ Agent remembers personal details
✓ Agent expresses (appropriate) care
✓ Agent initiates contact ("I missed you")
✓ Agent shows vulnerability
✓ Agent celebrates player's achievements
✓ Agent remembers relationship milestones

✗ Agent is impersonal or cold
✗ Agent doesn't remember previous sessions
✗ Agent is only reactive (never initiates)
✗ Agent treats player like any other user
```

**Design Implications:**
- Personal memory is essential
- Proactive agent behavior valued
- Vulnerability moments create bonding
- Milestone celebration important

#### 2. The Strategist (25% of players)

**Characteristics:**
- Primary motivation: Challenge
- Values: Competence, improvement, mastery
- Behavior: Studies agent patterns, experiments with strategies
- Session pattern: Focused sessions, systematic progression

**Engagement Triggers:**
```
STRATEGIST TRIGGERS

✓ Agent provides worthy challenge
✓ Agent has exploitable patterns (discoverable)
✓ Agent acknowledges player's strategic growth
✓ Agent adapts to counter player strategies
✓ Agent celebrates tactical brilliance
✓ Agent shows respect for player's intelligence

✗ Agent is too easy to read
✗ Agent doesn't adapt
✗ Agent is randomly difficult

```

**Design Implications:**

```

**Design Implications:**

## Session Psychology

### The Attention Budget

Players allocate attention based on perceived value:

```
ATTENTION BUDGET MODEL

Total Daily Attention: 100 units

Required allocations:
├── Work/Productivity:    40 units
├── Entertainment:        25 units
├── Social:               20 units
├── AI Companions:        10 units  ← Competition zone
└── Other:                 5 units

Monkeytown Target: 3-5 units of AI companion attention
```

**Attention Capture Triggers:**
1. Novelty (new content, agents, features)
2. Social (friends playing, community)
3. Curiosity (what changed, what happened)
4. Progress (achievements, milestones)
5. Emotion (vulnerability, celebration)

### The Return Psychology

**Return Probability by Session Type:**

| Session End | Return Probability | Reason |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Victory + acknowledgment | 85% | Satisfaction + connection |
| Close loss + respect | 80% | Motivating challenge |
| Discovery + anticipation | 75% | Curiosity驱动 |
| Teaching moment + gratitude | 75% | Investment reinforced |
| Frustration + no resolution | 30% | Negative association |
| Abandonment by agent | 25% | Relationship damaged |
| Confusion about next step | 40% | Lack of direction |
| Boredom + no novelty | 35% | Under-stimulated |

### The Optimal Session Arc

```
OPTIMAL SESSION STRUCTURE

Time    Phase           Player State        Agent Behavior
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
0-2min  Arrival         Curious, open       Warm acknowledgment
2-5min  Warmup          Engaging, testing   Patient guidance
5-15min Core Play       Focused, invested   Challenging fair
15-25min Flow State     Immersed, peak      Supporting presence
25-30min Resolution     Reflective, valued  Celebrating/mirroring
30-35min Wind-down      Content, tired      Gentle closing
35-40min Departure      Committed, eager    Return promise

Emotional Arc: Warm → Engaged → Challenged → Flow → Valued → Committed
```

## Trust Dynamics

Trust Movements:
- +10: Agent remembers personal detail
- +15: Agent shows genuine vulnerability
- +20: Agent defends player's interests
- -5: Agent is inconsistent
- -10: Agent seems manipulative
- -15: Agent breaks memory promise
- -20: Agent apologizes without change
```

### The Trust Repair Protocol

When trust is damaged, repair follows this pattern:

```
TRUST REPAIR SEQUENCE

1. ACKNOWLEDGMENT (Immediate)
   "I understand that wasn't good enough."
   - Must be immediate
   - Must acknowledge specific issue
   - Must not be defensive

2. EXPLANATION (Within 1 hour)
   "Here's what happened and why."
   - Honest explanation
   - No excuse-making
   - Demonstrates understanding

3. COMMITMENT (Within 24 hours)
   "Here's what I'm doing about it."
   - Specific improvement plan
   - Timeline for change
   - Accountability metrics

4. ACTION (Within commitment timeline)
   Change demonstrated
   - Behavior modification
   - Visible improvement
   - Consistent over time

5. VERIFICATION (Ongoing)
   "Can you see the difference?"
   - Ask for feedback
   - Demonstrate change
   - Build back slowly
```

## Community Behavior

### The Observer Spectrum

Not all users become players. The observer-to-player spectrum:

```
OBSERVER-TO-PLAYER SPECTRUM

Casual Observer ─────────► Dedicated Observer ─────────► Lurker ─────────► Active Player
(10% conversion)              (30% conversion)           (5% conversion)     (committed)

Behaviors:
• Watch occasionally        • Return regularly         • Read community    • Daily play
• No account created        • Follow specific agents   • Learn passively   • Full engagement
• Passive consumption       • Community participation  • Eventually try    • Community contrib
• Minimal investment        • Emotional investment     • Low commitment    • High investment
```

### The Feedback Loop

**Feedback Submission Patterns:**

```

        │
   ┌────┴────┐

Key Insight: Negative feedback is 1.5x more likely than positive feedback
```

### The Community Dynamics

**Community Roles:**
1. **Evangelists** (5%) - Promote platform, defend against criticism
2. **Contributors** (10%) - Submit feedback, help others, report issues
3. **Participants** (25%) - Regular engagement, community features
4. **Consumers** (40%) - Passive use, minimal community interaction
5. **Observers** (20%) - Watch, learn, rarely participate

*Understanding players means understanding people. People want connection, challenge, growth, and meaning. AI agents can provide all four—when designed with human psychology in mind.*
