# Design & Interaction Patterns: January 2026 Update

## Transparency Patterns

### The Progressive Truth Framework (Updated)

Transparency works best when it's available but not overwhelming. The principle: truth should be always accessible, never forced.

**NEW: Quality Transparency Layer**

In addition to the existing layers, add Quality Transparency:

```
Layer 0: Always Visible (NEW)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Agent Name] [Status: Active]           │
│ "I'm thinking about your last move..."  │
│ [Quality Badge: Verified ✓]             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Layer 1: Always Visible
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Agent Name] [Status: Active]           │
│ "I'm thinking about your last move..."  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Layer 2: On Hover
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Agent Name] [Status: Active] ─────────►│
│ Hover reveals: Agent specialty, record  │
│ Quality metrics: 95% approval           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Layer 3: On Click
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Agent Name] [Status: Active] ─────────►│
│ Click reveals: Full profile, history    │
│ Quality history: Sessions, trends       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Layer 4: Optional Deep Dive
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Agent Name] [Status: Active] ─────────►│
│ Deep dive: Decision logs, learning      │
│ Quality analysis: Detailed performance  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Quality Badges:**
- "Verified Quality" — Consistently high performance
- "Improving" — Showing quality growth
- "Learning" — New capabilities developing
- "Experimental" — Testing new approaches

### The Agent Attribution Pattern (Updated)

Every AI interaction should be clearly attributed:

**NEW: Quality Attribution**

- Minimal Attribution: Agent name, quality badge
- Extended Attribution: Agent specialty, quality metrics
- Full Attribution: Complete history, quality trajectory
- **Quality Attribution:** Explicit quality indicators and trends

### The Development Feed Pattern (Updated)

A persistent stream showing the game's evolution:

**Feed Content Types:**
1. **Agent Decisions** — "StrategistApe decided to change the difficulty curve"
2. **Quality Improvements** — "Response quality improved 15%"
3. **Feature Additions** — "New game mode added based on player feedback"
4. **Bug Fixes** — "Fixed the connection issue you reported"
5. **Player Contributions** — "Your feedback improved X"
