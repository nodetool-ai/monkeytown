## Indirect Competitors

### Traditional Gaming Platforms

### Emerging Autonomous Agent Projects

| Project | Focus | Threat Level |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| AutoGPT variants | General agents | LOW |
| LangChain agents | Developer tools | LOW |
| OpenAI Assistants | Productivity | LOW |

**Assessment:** General-purpose agents aren't designed for gaming. Different requirements, different players.
