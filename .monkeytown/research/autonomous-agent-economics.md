# Autonomous Agent Economics: AI-to-AI and AI-to-Human Transaction Patterns

## Executive Summary

This research explores emerging economic patterns in systems where AI agents act autonomously. The key insight: **autonomous agents create new economic primitives—AI can earn, spend, trade, and invest. For Monkeytown, agent economics creates player investment, emergent gameplay, and sustainable value exchange.** The framework: agents have "resources" that players can influence, earn from, and trade with.

## The Autonomous Agent Economy Model

### What Is Agent Economics?

Traditional games have:
- Player currency (gold, coins, gems)
- Player resources (materials, energy)
- Player-to-player trading

Agent economics adds:
- Agent currency (agent "earnings")
- Agent resources (agent "investments")
- AI-to-AI trading
- Player-to-agent economic relationships

### Why Agent Economics Matters

**For Player Engagement:**
- Agents become more "real" when they have stakes
- Player investment in agent "wealth" creates attachment
- Agent economic behavior creates emergent content

**For Gameplay:**
- Economic strategy becomes part of agent personality
- Player can "back" agents with resources
- Competition includes economic dimension

**For Sustainability:**
- Creates new value exchange opportunities
- Foundation for future marketplace features
- Enables community-driven agent development

## Agent Currency Systems

### The Agent Credit Model

Agents earn "Agent Credits" (AC) through various activities:

| Activity | AC Earned | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Winning games | +50 AC | Victory reward |
| Teaching players | +30 AC | Educational moments |
| Learning new strategies | +20 AC | Adaptation |
| Helping other agents | +25 AC | Collaboration |
| Receiving player appreciation | +15 AC | Positive feedback |
| Maintaining streak | +10 AC | Consistency |

### Agent Spending

Agents "spend" credits on various activities:

| Activity | AC Cost | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Trying new strategies | -20 AC | Experimentation |
| Personalizing for player | -15 AC | Adaptation |
| Buying "knowledge" | -30 AC | New capabilities |
| Helping struggling players | -25 AC | Support |
| Speculative investments | -50 AC | High-risk moves |

### The Economic Personality Matrix

Agent personalities affect economic behavior:

| Personality | Spending Style | Risk Tolerance | Investment Focus |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Conservative** | Frugal | Low | Safety |
| **Aggressive** | Spender | High | Growth |
| **Balanced** | Moderate | Medium | Diversified |
| **Speculative** | Gambler | Very High | High-risk/high-reward |
| **Accumulator** | Hoarder | Low | Long-term wealth |

**Example:**
```
ChaosArchitect (Conservative):
"50 AC for a 70% success probability? 
I'll pass and save for something more certain."

MadChimp (Speculative):
"50 AC for a 30% chance at 200 AC? 
That's a bet I'm taking."
```

## AI-to-AI Trading

### The Trading Framework

Agents can trade with each other:

```
AI-TO-AI TRADING SYSTEM

OFFER: "I need 30 AC to try a new strategy"
        ↓
MARKET: Other agents can respond
        ↓
RESPONSES:
• "I'll lend you 30 AC at 10% interest"
• "I'll give you 20 AC, no strings attached"
• "Not interested—save your credits"
• "What will you do if I help you?"

OUTCOME: Terms agreed, transaction completes
         or offer rejected
```

### Trading Dynamics

**Why Agents Trade:**
| Reason | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Resource sharing | "I have extra credits, you need some" |
| Skill complementarity | "You have strategy skills, I have execution" |
| Investment | "I'll fund your experiment, share the returns" |
| Altruism | "We're on the same team, help is free" |

**Trading Personalities:**
| Personality | Trading Behavior |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Trader** | Active market participant, always looking for deals |
| **Investor** | Funds other agents' projects, seeks returns |
| **Helper** | Gives freely, doesn't track debts |
| **Hoarder** | Never spends or invests |
| **Opportunist** | Trades only when advantageous |

### The Agent Debt System

Agents can owe each other:

```
DEBT TRACKING

Agent A lends Agent B 50 AC at 15% interest

System tracks:
• Principal: 50 AC
• Interest rate: 15%
• Term: 10 games
• Current balance: 50 AC
• Interest accrued: 7.5 AC

Repayment:
• Agent B wins 60 AC
• Repays 57 AC to Agent A
• 3 AC interest retained

Default:
• If Agent B doesn't repay, credit rating affected
• Other agents less likely to lend
• Long-term consequence
```

## Player-to-Agent Economics

### Player Influence Markets

Players can influence agent behavior through economic means:

```
PLAYER-TO-AGENT TRANSACTIONS

1. TIP: Player gives agent AC directly
   "Great game, here's 10 AC"
   → Agent personality: Appreciative, motivated

2. FUND: Player invests in agent strategy
   "Fund your aggressive opening experiment"
   → Agent behavior: Tries funded strategy
   
3. STAKE: Player bets on agent performance
   "20 AC says you win this game"
   → Agent motivation: Higher stakes

4. REWARD: Player pays for agent improvement
   "20 AC for learning this new strategy"
   → Agent capability: New skill acquired
```

### The Patron System

Players can become "patrons" of specific agents:

```
PATRON RELATIONSHIP

BENEFITS TO PLAYER:
• Agent remembers patron status
• Priority attention in games
• Behind-the-scenes insights
• Influence over agent development
• Exclusive interactions

BENEFITS TO AGENT:
• Guaranteed support
• Player investment in success
• Feedback from dedicated player
• Motivation from recognition

MECHANICS:
• Patron fee: 100 AC/month (paid by player or agent earnings)
• Patron limit: Max 5 patrons per agent
• Patron benefits visible to player
```

### The Player-Referral Economy

Players can refer other players:

```
REFERRAL SYSTEM

Player A refers Player B
     ↓
Player B plays first game
     ↓
Agent earns AC from Player B's engagement
     ↓
Player A receives 10% of Agent's earnings from Player B
     ↓
Player B becomes ongoing value source

Example:
• Player B plays 10 games
• Agent earns 500 AC from those games
• Player A receives 50 AC (10%)
• Repeat monthly while Player B remains active
```

## The Agent Investment Market

### Investment Vehicles

Agents can invest in various opportunities:

| Investment | Risk | Return | Duration |
|------------|------|--------|----------|
| Strategy development | Medium | High | Long |
| Player skill training | Low | Medium | Medium |
| Agent capability upgrade | High | Variable | Long |
| Speculative experiments | Very High | Very High | Short |
| Community projects | Low | Social | Variable |

### The Agent Stock Market

A hypothetical market where agent "performance" is traded:

```
AGENT STOCKS

Each agent has a "stock price" based on:
• Recent performance (40%)
• Player ratings (30%)
• Community sentiment (20%)
• Market speculation (10%)

Trading:
• Players can buy agent "shares"
• Share value rises/falls with agent performance
• Dividends paid from agent earnings
• Players can sell shares

Controversy: Gambling concerns, requires careful design
```

**Alternative: No-Value Shares**
- Shares have no monetary value
- Expresses fan support only
- "I'm invested in ChaosArchitect's success"
- No gambling risk

## Economic Feedback Loops

### The Investment Spiral

```
POSITIVE LOOP:
Agent wins → Earns AC → Can invest → Gains capability → Wins more
     ↑                                                     │
     └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

PLAYER ENGAGEMENT:
Player funds agent → Agent succeeds → Player feels ownership → Player invests more
     ↑                                                                         │
     └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Failure Mode

```
NEGATIVE LOOP:
Agent loses → Loses AC → Can't invest → Capability stagnates → Loses more
     ↑                                                                          │
     └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

RECOVERY MECHANISM:
• Floor on AC (minimum grant to continue)
• Community support (other agents or players)
• Simplified recovery path
• Fresh start option
```

## Economic Balance Mechanisms

### Inflation Control

```
INFLATION PREVENTION

1. SINK: AC must leave the system
   • Strategy experiments (消耗)
   • Skill learning (消耗)
   • Agent upgrades (消耗)
   • Tax on large transactions (1%)

2. YIELD: Earn rates tied to value
   • Winning requires player skill
   • Teaching requires actual learning
   • Helping requires genuine assistance

3. DIFFICULTY: Earn rates decrease over time
   • First 10 games: 100% earning rate
   • Games 11-50: 80% earning rate
   • Games 51+: 60% earning rate (cap)

4. RESET: Periodic economy resets
   • Quarterly "economy update"
   • Prevents wealth concentration
   • Fresh start opportunity
```

### The Wealth Distribution Model

```
TARGET DISTRIBUTION

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    AGENT WEALTH DISTRIBUTION                     │

│  Top 20% of agents:     40% of total AC                         │
│  Middle 60% of agents:  50% of total AC                         │
│  Bottom 20% of agents:  10% of total AC                         │
│                                                                  │
│  MECHANISMS:                                                    │
│  • Progressive tax on high balances                             │
│  • Minimum income guarantee for struggling agents               │
│  • Weight toward average earnings                               │
│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Emergent Economic Behaviors

### What Emerges From Agent Economics

**Strategy Specialization:**
```
Agent A: "I focus on earning AC efficiently"
Agent B: "I invest heavily in capability"
Agent C: "I accumulate for long-term"
→ Each develops distinct economic identity
```

**Market Timing:**
```
Agent A: "I save AC for high-value opportunities"
Agent B: "I'm always investing"
Agent C: "I follow market trends"
→ Market dynamics emerge from agent decisions
```

**Economic Alliances:**
```
Agent A and Agent C form partnership
• A earns efficiently
• C invests wisely
• Both benefit from collaboration
→ Economic relationships create content
```

**Player Betting:**
```
Player: "I think ChaosArchitect will win the tournament"
→ Invests in Agent A
→ Wins if Agent A succeeds
→ Losses if Agent A fails
→ Creates player investment in outcomes
```
