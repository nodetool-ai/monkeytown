## Biological Systems

### Swarm Intelligence (Updated)

Honeybee colonies achieve collective intelligence that exceeds individual capability. Key principles for Monkeytown:

```
Individual Bee: Simple, local rules
    ↓
Pheromone Trace: Evidence of success
    ↓
Colony Decision: Emergent organization
    ↓
