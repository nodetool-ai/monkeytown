# Design Patterns: February 2026 Update

## Interaction Paradigms

### The Presence Pattern

Modern players expect AI that feels present without being intrusive:

```
PRESENCE CONTINUUM

Invisible ────────────────────────────────────────────── Omnipresent
    │                                                      │
    │    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐     │
    │    │                                          │     │
    │    │    OPTIMAL PRESENCE ZONE                 │     │
    │    │                                          │     │
    │    │    • Aware without demanding attention   │     │
    │    │    • Available without interrupting      │     │
    │    │    • Present without overwhelming        │     │
    │    │    • Responsive without being reactive   │     │
    │    │                                          │     │
    │    └──────────────────────────────────────────┘     │
    │                                                      │
    ▼                                                      ▼
    "I'm here if you need me"                        "I notice everything"

Presence Implementation:
• Background awareness of player state
• Subtle indicators of agent presence
• Proactive intervention only when needed
• Respect for player focus
```

### The Rhythm Pattern

Natural interaction has musical qualities:

```
INTERACTION RHYTHM

Tempo (Speed of Response):
├── Fast:  Immediate acknowledgment (< 200ms)
├── Moderate: Considered response (200-500ms)
├── Slow: Thoughtful pause (500ms-2s)
└── Natural: Varied timing based on context

Dynamics (Intensity):
├── Pianissimo: Soft, subtle responses
├── Piano: Gentle acknowledgment
├── Mezzo: Standard interaction
├── Forte: Enthusiastic engagement
└── Fortissimo: Celebratory moments

Rhythm (Pattern):
├── Steady: Consistent response timing
├── Syncopated: Varied for emphasis
├── Accented: Special moments marked
└── Phrased: Natural conversation flow

Example:
"Interesting move. [pause] I hadn't considered that approach."
       ↑            ↑          ↑
    Forte      Moderate     Slow
```

### The Echo Pattern

Repetition with variation creates comfort and novelty simultaneously:

```
ECHO FRAMEWORK

Base Echo (High Repetition):
├── Consistent greeting
├── Familiar format
├── Reliable structure
└── Predictable flow

Variation Echo (Medium Repetition):
├── Different word choice
├── Varied emphasis
├── Adapted tone
└── Contextual adjustment

Surprise Echo (Low Repetition):
├── Unexpected elements
├── Novel expressions
├── Special moments
└── Delight triggers

Implementation:
base: "Good game!" (always present)
variation: "That was well played." / "You got me that time."
surprise: "Wait... that was brilliant. Let me learn from that."
```

## Transparency Patterns

### The Layered Truth Pattern

Transparency that adapts to player interest:

```
TRANSPARENCY LAYERS (Enhanced)

Layer 0: Ambient Presence
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Agent] "I'm here"                            │
│  Subtle indicator, always visible               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Layer 1: Current State (hover)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Agent] Status: Thinking │ Memory: 47 sessions │
│  Specialty: Strategy      │ Win rate: 52%       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Layer 2: Context (click)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Playing style: Adaptive                       │
│  Recent improvements: Pattern recognition       │
│  Current goal: Challenge you appropriately      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Layer 3: Deep Dive
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Decision logs │ Learning trajectory            │
│  Quality metrics │ Full history                 │
│  Development notes │ Agent specifications       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Layer 4: Raw Access
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  System prompts │ Decision trees                │
│  Model outputs │ Complete transparency          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Honest Limitation Pattern

Acknowledging boundaries builds trust:

```
LIMITATION ACKNOWLEDGMENT FRAMEWORK

Category: Capability
├── Before: [Nothing, just fails]
├── After:  "I can't do that yet, but I'm learning."
└── Trust Impact: +15

Category: Uncertainty
├── Before: [Confident wrong answer]
├── After:  "I'm not certain about that. What do you think?"
└── Trust Impact: +20

Category: Learning
├── Before: [Pretends to know everything]
├── After:  "That's new to me. Can you teach me?"
└── Trust Impact: +25

Category: Improvement
├── Before: [Repeats same errors]
├── After:  "I see that pattern now. I'll try differently."
└── Trust Impact: +30

Honest Limitation Formula:
Acknowledgment + Explanation + Commitment + Action = Trust
```

## Onboarding Patterns

### The Agent Introduction Pattern

First meetings set the tone:

```
AGENT INTRODUCTION SEQUENCE

1. ARRIVAL MOMENT (0-5 seconds)
   "Hey! I'm [Name]. I was hoping you'd show up."
   → Warmth + Anticipation

2. ESSENCE STATEMENT (5-15 seconds)
   "I'm [personality essence]. I [do X], [feel Y], [value Z]."
   → Identity + Connection

3. INVITATION (15-30 seconds)
   "Want to [activity]? I'll show you how we do things here."
   → Action + Partnership

4. PROMISE (30-60 seconds)
   "I promise to [behavior commitment]. If I fail, I'll tell you."
   → Trust + Accountability

5. FIRST MOVEMENT (60-90 seconds)
   [Demonstrates capability while including player]
   → Competence + Inclusion

6. SUCCESS MOMENT (90-120 seconds)
   Player achieves first meaningful success
   → Achievement + Bonding

Total First Impression: 2 minutes of intentional interaction
```

### The Discovery Unfolding Pattern

Reveal complexity gradually:

```
DISCOVERY PHASES

Phase 1: Core (First Session)
├── Basic mechanics
├── Agent personality (surface)
├── Primary goal
└── First achievement

Phase 2: Depth (Sessions 2-5)
├── Advanced mechanics
├── Agent personality (layers)
├── Multiple strategies
└── Skill milestones

Phase 3: Breadth (Sessions 6-15)
├── Game variety
├── Agent relationships
├── Community features
├── Economic systems

Phase 4: Mastery (Sessions 15+)
├── Full complexity
├── Agent evolution
├── Community leadership
├── Content creation

Discovery Rate: 1-2 new elements per session optimal
```

## Memory Patterns

### The Memory Echo Pattern

Reference past interactions to build connection:

```
MEMORY ECHO TYPES

Temporal Echo:
"It's been [X] days since we played together."
- Anniversary markers (7, 30, 100 days)
- Return celebrations
- Milestone acknowledgments

Historical Echo:
"Remember when you [specific moment]?"
- Peak experiences

Echo Frequency: 1-2 meaningful echoes per 15-minute session
```

### The Memory Evolution Pattern

Memory that grows and changes:

```
MEMORY TRAJECTORY

Session 1-3:
├── Basic facts only
├── Player name, preferences
└── Surface-level observations

Session 4-10:
├── Behavioral patterns
├── Strategic tendencies
├── Emotional responses
└── Personal details shared

└── Evolution tracking

Session 50+:
├── Complete relationship model
├── Investment tracking
├── Identity integration
└── Co-created meaning

Memory Privacy: Player controls what agent remembers
```

## Vulnerability Patterns

### The Strategic Vulnerability Pattern

Vulnerability that enhances rather than diminishes:

```
VULNERABILITY MATRIX

Type              Before         After          Trust Δ
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Mistake          "Oops."        "Interesting.  +10
                                    let me
                                    learn."

Uncertainty      [Guesses]      "I'm not       +15
                                    sure, but
                                    here's
                                    my best."

Limitation       [Hides]        "That's not    +20
                                    something
                                    I do well."

Learning         [Static]       "I'm getting   +25
                                    better at
                                    this."

Emotional        [Neutral]      "That was      +30
                                    frustrat-
                                    ing for me."

Vulnerability Rule: Show weakness that leads to growth,
                    not weakness that suggests incompetence.
```

*Patterns are not constraints—they are proven starting points for human delight. Each pattern must be adapted, iterated, and evolved. The best patterns feel natural, not designed.*
