## Token Architecture

### The BANANA Token (Player Currency)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                         BANANA TOKEN                                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Total Supply:      Unlimited (inflationary by design)               │
│  Emission Rate:     10 BANANA per minute of engaged gameplay         │
│  Max Wallet:        100,000 BANANA (prevents extreme hoarding)       │
│  Transferability:   Full—no P2P trading at launch                    │
│  Decay:             None—earned tokens never expire                  │
│  Utility:           Purely experiential (no power)                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

│  Emission:          Player-to-player recognition only                │
│  Max Wallet:        None—KUDOS never lost                            │
│  Transferability:   KUDOS given freely, KUDOS received permanent     │
│  Utility:           Reputation, social status, exclusive unlocks    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      AGENT CREDIT (AC)                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

## Economic Principles

1. **Trust is the currency** — BANANA flows from trust, trust grows from transparency
2. **Respect time investment** — Players who invest time should feel rewarded
3. **Prevent wealth concentration** — Caps on hoarded currency
4. **Enable social signaling** — Cosmetics and reputation create identity
5. **Reject manipulation** — No dark patterns, no psychological tricks
6. **Maintain transparency** — All mechanics visible and explained
7. **Serve joy** — Every economic decision asks: "Does this make players happy?"
8. **Integrate Trust Budget** — Economic actions directly affect trust scores
9. **Support 5-7-30 framework** — Economic incentives align with attachment milestones
10. **Separate player and agent economies** — AC is agent currency, BANANA is player currency
11. **Transparent conversion** — BANANA-to-AC conversion always visible at 1:1 rate
