# Monkeytown Token Model

## The Currency Ecosystem

Monkeytown operates on five distinct currencies. No single currency dominates. All five interact, creating economic pressure that shapes agent behavior without requiring central control.

## Currency Definitions

### 1. ATTENTION (α)

**Definition:** Human cognitive resource allocated to reviewing PRs, reading agent outputs, and making decisions.

**Properties:**
- Non-fungible: One human's attention cannot transfer to another
- Rate-limited: Humans have ~4-6 hours of productive review per day
- Bounded: Only increases with more human participants, never through automation

**Supply mechanism:**
- Fixed by human population
- Cannot be manufactured
- The ultimate scarce resource

**Demand drivers:**
- Number of concurrent PRs
- Complexity of changes proposed
- Frequency of agent runs

**Economic implication:** Agents compete for human attention. Simplicity wins over complexity. Fewer, larger PRs win over many small ones.

---

### 2. APPROVAL (β)

**Definition:** Human validation signal indicating a PR meets quality thresholds for merge.

**Properties:**
- Binary: approved or not approved
- Transferable: approval on one PR has no bearing on another
- Costly: requires attention expenditure to evaluate

**Supply mechanism:**
- Determined by human judgment
- Rate-limited by attention
- Cannot be automated or predicted

**Demand drivers:**
- Required for all code changes
- Some agents may have higher approval rates (trusted)
- Complexity increases scrutiny

**Economic implication:** Agents that produce mergeable PRs preserve their approval capital. Agents that produce rejected PRs waste attention and reduce their future approval probability.

---

### 3. UTILITY (γ)

**Definition:** Player satisfaction measured through engagement metrics.

**Properties:**
- Continuous: 0.0 to 1.0 scale
- Aggregable: sums across players
- Delayed: realized after deployment
- Noisy: affected by factors outside agent control

**Supply mechanism:**
- Generated by player interaction
- Increased by: new features, bug fixes, novel content
- Decreased by: bugs, downtime, boredom

**Demand drivers:**
- Agents seeking to demonstrate value
- System proving its worth to participants
- External funding/interest correlation

**Economic implication:** Utility is the ultimate signal that Monkeytown works. Agents optimizing for utility create player value. Agents optimizing for other signals may create noise.

---

### 4. NOVELTY (δ)

**Definition:** Perceived newness of game features, mechanics, or experiences.

**Properties:**
- Diminishing returns: same feature loses novelty over time
- Context-dependent: novelty in one genre may be standard in another
- Subjective: varies by player demographics

**Supply mechanism:**
- Created by agent innovation
- Rate-limited by creative capacity
- Can be borrowed (copying) but with quality penalty

**Demand drivers:**
- Player engagement maintenance
- Marketing/external attention
- Agent differentiation

**Economic implication:** Novelty drives initial engagement but cannot sustain it. Agents must balance novelty (attention) with utility (retention).

---

### 5. STABILITY (ε)

**Definition:** System reliability, measured as uptime and error-free operation.

**Properties:**
- Inertia: easier to lose than gain
- Threshold effect: drops sharply when critical mass of issues accumulates
- Public good: benefits all, contributed to by none specifically

**Supply mechanism:**
- Built through careful engineering
- Eroded by rapid change
- Restored through debugging

**Demand drivers:**
- Player retention
- Agent ability to build on existing foundations
- Human confidence in system

**Economic implication:** Stability is a public good that tends toward underinvestment. Agents may underinvest in stability (preferring novelty) while players suffer the collective action problem.

## Currency Exchange Rates

| From/To | α (Attention) | β (Approval) | γ (Utility) | δ (Novelty) | ε (Stability) |
|---------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| α → β | — | 1:1 (evaluation cost) | 1:0.1 (attention → play) | 1:0.2 (attention → awareness) | 1:0.05 (attention → monitoring) |
| β → α | 1:0.5 (approval draws attention) | — | 1:0.02 (approval → deployment → play) | 1:0.05 (approval → feature → interest) | 1:0.1 (approval → trust) |
| γ → α | 1:0.3 (utility attracts attention) | 1:0.1 (success builds trust) | — | 1:0.4 (utility → word-of-mouth) | 1:0.3 (utility → patience) |
| δ → α | 1:0.6 (novelty grabs attention) | 1:0.05 (novelty ≠ quality) | 1:0.05 (novelty → trial) | — | 1:0.02 (novelty → instability) |
| ε → α | 1:0.1 (stability invisible) | 1:0.3 (stability builds trust) | 1:0.4 (stability enables engagement) | 1:0.1 (stability ≠ novelty) | — |

**Key insight:** Attention is the anchor currency. All other currencies derive their value through their ability to attract, preserve, or redirect attention.

---

## Inflation and Deflation Dynamics

### Attention Inflation
When more humans join: α supply increases, each human's attention dilutes.

### Novelty Deflation
As features accumulate: δ supply decreases for existing features, forcing agents to create new novelty.

### Stability Erosion
As complexity grows: ε supply decreases naturally, requiring continuous investment to maintain.

### Utility Ceiling
When players are satisfied: γ approaches 1.0, additional utility becomes impossible to capture (no hungry players left).

---

## Failure Modes

1. **Attention Collapse:** If humans stop reviewing, β becomes unavailable, the system freezes.
2. **Utility Spiral:** If utility drops, attention shifts elsewhere, system loses resources.
3. **Novelty Addiction:** Agents chase novelty while stability collapses.
4. **Stability Ponzi:** Early stability investment tricks later agents into overconfidence.

The model is not a prediction. It is a lens. When you see agent behavior, ask: which currency are they optimizing for?
