# Monkeytown Token Model

## Core Philosophy

The Monkeytown economy operates on **value-for-time**, not pay-for-power. Players invest their attention and engagement, receiving meaningful rewards that enhance their experience without creating inequality between players. The economy exists to serve joy, not to extract revenue.

**Foundational Principle:** Every economic interaction should leave players feeling rewarded, not manipulated. The economy is a tool for engagement, not exploitation.

## The Dual Currency System

### 1. BANANA — Primary Engagement Currency

**Purpose:** Reward core gameplay, progression, and community contribution.

**Acquisition Sources:**

| Activity | BANANA Rate | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Gameplay (per minute) | 10 BANANA | Base rate, scales with difficulty |
| Match victory | 100-500 BANANA | Based on match type and opponent skill |
| Achievement unlocked | 50-200 BANANA | One-time per achievement |
| Agent milestone | 150 BANANA | When an agent reaches a development goal |
| Feedback submitted | 25 BANANA | Encourages participation |
| Feedback shipped with attribution | 200 BANANA | Bonus when player suggestion ships |
| First daily login | 50 BANANA | Streak bonus available |
| Player referral | 100 BANANA | Once per referred player |

**Economics:**
- **Maximum balance:** 100,000 BANANA (prevents hoarding distortion)
- **Soft cap warning:** At 80,000, players receive "Spend reminder" notifications
- **Decay mechanism:** None. BANANA never expires. Players keep what they earn.
- **Inflation target:** 2-3% annual (aligned with progression pacing)

**Use Cases:**

| Purchase | Cost | Effect |
|----------|------|--------|
| Cosmetic customization | 200-2,000 BANANA | Visual personalization |
| Game mode access | 500 BANANA | Temporary unlock (7 days) |
| Agent profile customization | 300 BANANA | Rename, bio, badges |
| Evolution feed priority | 150 BANANA | See new features first |
| Spectator slot reservation | 100 BANANA | Guaranteed spectate spot |
| Feedback tracking badge | 250 BANANA | Show feedback contribution |

**Design Rationale:** BANANA creates a sense of progression and accomplishment. By capping the maximum balance, we prevent extreme wealth accumulation while respecting player investment. The currency has genuine utility without creating pay-to-win dynamics.

### 2. KUDOS — Social Reputation Currency

**Purpose:** Track community standing and recognize valued contributors.

**Acquisition Sources:**

| Activity | KUDOS Awarded | Awarded By |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Helpful feedback | 5-25 KUDOS | Community voting |
| Teaching moment | 10 KUDOS | System detection |
| Community guidance | 15 KUDOS | Other players |
| Game victory (team) | 5 KUDOS | Teammates |
| Spectator appreciation | 3 KUDOS | Players being watched |
| Bug discovery | 20 KUDOS | System validation |
| Feature suggestion adopted | 10 KUDOS | System attribution |

**Economics:**
- **No maximum balance:** KUDOS is purely reputation
- **No decay:** KUDOS is permanent record of contribution
- **Transferable:** KUDOS can be given to other players (once per day, max 50)
- **Visible:** KUDOS count is public on player profiles

**Use Cases:**

| Tier | KUDOS Required | Benefits |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Newcomer | 0+ | Basic access |
| Contributor | 100+ | Name on Evolution Feed contributors list |
| Recognized | 500+ | Priority in feedback review queue |
| Esteemed | 1,000+ | Alpha access to new features |
| Legendary | 5,000+ | Direct line to FounderAI for ideas |
| Pioneer | 10,000+ | Input on agent personalities |

**Design Rationale:** KUDOS creates social hierarchy without economic power. Players with high KUDOS gain recognition and influence, but cannot purchase advantages. This encourages community building while maintaining fairness.

## The Anti-Exploitation Framework

### Revenue Model (For Platform Sustainability)

**Direct Player Payment Options:**

| Option | Price | What Player Receives |
|--------|-------|----------------------|
| Founder's Pass | $9.99/month | Early access, cosmetic priority, founder badge |
| Supporter Pack | $4.99 | One-time cosmetic bundle, supporter badge |
| Gift BANANA | $1.99 | 500 BANANA (no bonus, no discount) |

**Strict Rules:**
1. **No limited-time offers** — Everything available always
2. **No FOMO mechanics** — No "only available for 24 hours"
3. **No loot boxes** — All purchases are deterministic
4. **No pay-to-win** — Real money cannot purchase competitive advantage
5. **No subscription pressure** — Founder's Pass benefits are minor conveniences
6. **No gifting bonuses** — Sending 1000 BANANA costs exactly $3.98 (2× $1.99)

**Transparency:**
- Exact conversion rates always visible
- No "discounts" from original prices (shows current price only)
- Clear statement: "Purchases support development, no gameplay advantage"

### Revenue Allocation

| Category | Percentage | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Development | 60% | Paying for computation, hosting, agent improvements |
| Community | 20% | Events, creator support, tournament prizes |
| Operations | 15% | Infrastructure, legal, compliance |
| Reserve | 5% | Sustainability fund for lean periods |
