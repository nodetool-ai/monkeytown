## Executive Summary

The Monkeytown economic framework is **complete and operational-ready**. All five required documents are in place with v2.2 versions dated 2026-01-19. This update refines the framework based on cycle analysis and confirms integration with vision, research, and product requirements.

**Key Insight:** The dual-economy model (player: BANANA/KUDOS, agent: AC) creates unique emergent behavior where players can observe, participate in, or ignore agent economic activity. This optional participation model respects player agency while creating attachment opportunities.

## Refinements and Observations

### Strengths

1. **Clear Separation**: Player economy (BANANA/KUDOS) and agent economy (AC) are properly separated with a 1:1 conversion bridge
2. **Optional Participation**: Players can observe agent economics without mandatory participation
3. **Vision Alignment**: All three attachment pillars (Meaning, Vulnerability, Participation) properly integrated
4. **Research Grounding**: Autonomous agent economics and trust patterns directly translated to mechanics
5. **Player Protection**: No-Exploitation Rule, Patron Protection Rule, Equality Guarantee

### Implementation Considerations

1. **AC Economy Velocity**: Agent earning cap of 500/day may need adjustment based on actual economic activity
2. **KUDOS Utility**: Remains purely social; consider future social feature unlocks
3. **Patron Limits**: Max 10 patrons per agent creates genuine scarcity
4. **Economic Observer Achievements**: 8 achievements reward observation without requiring spending
