# Monkeytown Economic Rules

## Foundational Laws

These rules govern all economic activity in Monkeytown. They are non-negotiable and enforced at the system level.

---

## Law 1: The Transparency Principle

**Rule:** Every economic formula, rate, and calculation is visible to players.

**Implementation:**
- All exchange rates displayed before transaction
- Exact earning rates shown for every activity
- Formulas documented in public documentation
- No "hidden math" or obscured calculations

**Enforcement:** System rejects any transaction where rates aren't clearly displayed.

---

## Law 2: The No-Exploitation Rule

**Rule:** The economy must never manipulate, coerce, or exploit players.

**Prohibited Patterns:**
```
❌ Artificial urgency ("Only 24 hours!")
❌ Fear of missing out (FOMO) mechanics
❌ Social pressure to spend
❌ Loss aversion tactics
❌ Variable ratio reinforcement (loot boxes)
❌ Dark patterns in UI design
```

**Allowed Patterns:**
```
✓ Clear value propositions
✓ Time-bound events with advance notice
✓ Voluntary social sharing
✓ Predictable rewards
✓ Transparent probability (when applicable)
```

## Law 3: The Equality Guarantee

**Rule:** No player can purchase competitive advantage.

**Implications:**
- Real money cannot directly increase win probability
- All gameplay-affecting items available through gameplay
- Time investment and money investment are not interchangeable for gameplay advantage
- Cosmetic differentiation only

**Enforcement:** Any item that affects gameplay balance must have gameplay acquisition path.

---

## Law 4: The Preservation Mandate

**Rule:** Player investment must never be devalued or lost.

**Protections:**
- BANANA never expires
- Achievements never revoked
- KUDOS never removed (except for egregious violations)
- Progress saves across sessions
- No "resets" or "new seasons" that invalidate progress

**Exception:** Account termination for severe violations may remove value.

---

## Law 5: The Anti-Inflation Control

**Rule:** Currency value must remain stable over time.

**Controls:**
- BANANA earning rate caps prevent hyperinflation
- Regular economic audits (monthly)
- Automatic adjustment triggers when inflation exceeds 5%
- Sink mechanisms to remove excess currency

**Target:** 2-3% annual inflation aligned with progression pacing.

---

## Law 6: The Fair Exchange Rule

**Rule:** All exchanges must provide fair value to both parties.

**Requirements:**
- BANANA purchase price never increases based on balance
- No "dynamic pricing" based on player behavior
- Exchange rates remain consistent for 30-day windows
- Promotional bonuses clearly labeled as temporary

---

## Law 7: The No-Backdating Rule

**Rule:** Economic changes cannot retroactively affect player value.

**Implications:**
- New items don't invalidate old purchases
- Balance changes affect future earning only
- Price changes don't apply to already-purchased items
- Policy changes apply going forward only

---

## Law 8: The Gifting Transparency Rule

**Rule:** All gifting is visible and tracked.

**Requirements:**
- Gift recipients are notified
- Gift history visible in player profile
- No anonymous gifting
- Gift value counts toward recipient's economy participation

## Balance Rules

### Earning Rate Formulas

**Base Formula:**

BANANA = (Base_Rate × Time_Minutes × Difficulty_Modifier) + Bonus
```

Where:
- Base_Rate = 10 BANANA/minute
- Difficulty_Modifier = 1.0 (standard), 1.5 (hard), 2.0 (expert)
- Bonus = match victory, achievements, events

**Victory Bonus Formula:**
```
Victory_Bonus = Base_Bonus × (Opponent_Skill / Player_Skill) × Streak_Modifier
```

Where:
- Base_Bonus = 100 BANANA
- Opponent_Skill/Player_Skill = 0.8 to 1.2 range
- Streak_Modifier = 1.0 to 2.0 based on consecutive victories

### Spending Rate Guidelines

**Cosmetic Pricing:**
- Common: 200-500 BANANA
- Uncommon: 500-1,000 BANANA
- Rare: 1,000-2,000 BANANA
- Legendary: 2,000-5,000 BANANA

All rules are subordinate to this principle.
