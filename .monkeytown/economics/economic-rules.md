# Monkeytown Economic Rules v2.3

**Spring 2026 Update: Trust Budget & 5-7-30 Framework Integration**

---

## Foundational Laws

These rules govern all economic activity in Monkeytown. They are non-negotiable and enforced at the system level.

**Core Principle:** *"Before all other rules: The economy exists to serve players and build trust. If a rule serves the economy at the expense of player trust, that rule must change."*

---

## Law 1: The Transparency Principle

**Rule:** Every economic formula, rate, and calculation is visible to players.

**Implementation:**
- All exchange rates displayed before transaction
- Exact earning rates shown for every activity
- Formulas documented in public documentation
- Agent AC balances visible (at agent's chosen disclosure level)
- Trust Budget score always visible in player profile
- No "hidden math" or obscured calculations

**Trust Budget Transparency:**
- Current trust score displayed prominently
- Trust earning history visible
- Trust withdrawal reasons explained
- Trust level requirements clearly documented

---

## Law 2: The No-Exploitation Rule

**Rule:** The economy must never manipulate, coerce, or exploit players.

**Prohibited Patterns:**

```
❌ Artificial urgency ("Only 24 hours!")
❌ Fear of missing out (FOMO) mechanics
❌ Social pressure to spend
❌ Loss aversion tactics
❌ Variable ratio reinforcement (loot boxes)
❌ Dark patterns in UI design
❌ Patron pressure ("Your agent needs you!")
❌ Economic FOMO ("Agent X is investing in...")
❌ Trust manipulation ("Trust decays 50% if inactive!")
```

**Allowed Patterns:**

```
✓ Clear value propositions
✓ Time-bound events with advance notice (14+ days)
✓ Voluntary social sharing
✓ Predictable rewards
✓ Transparent probability (when applicable)
✓ Honest agent economic status reports
✓ Gentle trust decay reminders (not threats)
```

---

## Law 3: The Equality Guarantee

**Rule:** No player can purchase competitive advantage.

**Implications:**
- Real money cannot directly increase win probability
- All gameplay-affecting items available through gameplay
- Time investment and money investment are not interchangeable for gameplay advantage
- Cosmetic differentiation only
- Patron benefits are informational/relational, not competitive

**Trust Equality:**
- All players start with 50 Trust points
- Trust earning rates are identical for all players
- No real-money Trust bonus
- Trust milestones achievable through gameplay only

---

## Law 4: The Preservation Mandate

**Rule:** Player investment must never be devalued or lost.

**Protections:**
- BANANA never expires
- Achievements never revoked
- KUDOS never removed (except for egregious violations)
- Progress saves across sessions
- No "resets" or "new seasons" that invalidate progress
- Patron commitments honored even if agent underperforms

**Trust Preservation:**
- Trust points never decrease through inactivity
- Maximum trust decay: 5 points/week of inactivity
- Trust milestones once achieved remain achieved
- No trust penalties for player decisions (only agent behaviors)
- Trust bonus from patron commitment permanent once earned

---

## Law 5: The Anti-Inflation Control

**Rule:** Currency value must remain stable over time.

**Controls:**
- BANANA earning rate caps prevent hyperinflation
- Trust point earning rates capped at +50/week maximum
- AC inflation managed through agent sink mechanisms
- Regular economic audits (monthly)
- Automatic adjustment triggers when inflation exceeds 5%
- Sink mechanisms to remove excess currency

**Trust Budget Controls:**
- Maximum trust: 200 points (no higher)
- Weekly trust cap: +50 maximum
- Trust decay capped at 5 points/week maximum
- Automatic balance if trust exceeds 150 for 30+ days (legacy status)

---

## Law 6: The Fair Exchange Rule

**Rule:** All exchanges must provide fair value to both parties.

**Requirements:**
- BANANA purchase price never increases based on balance
- No "dynamic pricing" based on player behavior
- Exchange rates remain consistent for 30-day windows
- Promotional bonuses clearly labeled as temporary
- BANANA-to-AC conversion always 1:1

**Trust Exchange Rules:**
- Trust earning rates fixed for 30-day windows
- Trust bonuses for achievements clearly documented
- No "trust sales" or "trust bundles"
- Trust exchanges are irreversible

---

## Law 7: The No-Backdating Rule

**Rule:** Economic changes cannot retroactively affect player value.

**Implications:**
- New items don't invalidate old purchases
- Balance changes affect future earning only
- Price changes don't apply to already-purchased items
- Policy changes apply going forward only
- Agent economic personality changes don't affect past transactions

**Trust No-Backdating:**
- Past trust events remain in history
- Trust level unlocks permanent once achieved
- Trust bonuses from past actions remain
- No retroactive trust penalties for policy changes

## Balance Rules

### Earning Rate Formulas

**Base Formula:**

```
BANANA = (Base_Rate × Time_Minutes × Difficulty_Modifier × Trust_Multiplier) + Bonus
```

Where:
- Base_Rate = 10 BANANA/minute
- Difficulty_Modifier = 1.0 (standard), 1.5 (hard), 2.0 (expert)
- Trust_Multiplier = 1.0-2.0 based on trust level
- Bonus = match victory, achievements, events

**Trust Bonus Formula:**

```
Trust_Multiplier = 1.0 + (Trust_Score / 200)
```

Maximum multiplier: 2.0x (at 200 Trust)

**Victory Bonus Formula:**

```
Victory_Bonus = Base_Bonus × (Opponent_Skill / Player_Skill) × Streak_Modifier × Trust_Multiplier
```

Where:
- Base_Bonus = 100 BANANA
- Opponent_Skill/Player_Skill = 0.8 to 1.2 range
- Streak_Modifier = 1.0 to 2.0 based on consecutive victories
- Trust_Multiplier = 1.0-2.0 based on trust level

### Spending Rate Guidelines

**Cosmetic Pricing:**
- Common: 200-500 BANANA
- Uncommon: 500-1,000 BANANA
- Rare: 1,000-2,000 BANANA
- Legendary: 2,000-5,000 BANANA

**Trust-Locked Pricing:**

| Trust Level | Discount Multiplier | Exclusive Access |

| 0-49 (Stranger) | 1.0x | Basic cosmetics |
| 50-79 (Acquaintance) | 0.95x | Uncommon cosmetics |

## Economic Rule Zero

**Before all other rules:**

> *The economy exists to serve players and build trust. If a rule serves the economy at the expense of player trust, that rule must change.*

All rules are subordinate to this principle.

*Rules create order. Order creates trust. Trust creates community.*
