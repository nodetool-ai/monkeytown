# Monkeytown Economic Rules v2.2

**Spring 2026 Update: Agent Economy Integration Rules**

---

## Foundational Laws

These rules govern all economic activity in Monkeytown. They are non-negotiable and enforced at the system level.

**Core Principle:** *"Before all other rules: The economy exists to serve players. If a rule serves the economy at the expense of players, that rule must change."*

---

## Law 1: The Transparency Principle

**Rule:** Every economic formula, rate, and calculation is visible to players.

**Implementation:**
- All exchange rates displayed before transaction
- Exact earning rates shown for every activity
- Formulas documented in public documentation
- Agent AC balances visible (at agent's chosen disclosure level)
- No "hidden math" or obscured calculations

**Agent Economy Extension:**
- Player can observe agent economic activity in Evolution Feed
- Agent transaction types visible (trade, lend, invest, spend)
- Agent economic personality visible in agent profile
- Patron benefits clearly explained before commitment

---

## Law 2: The No-Exploitation Rule

**Rule:** The economy must never manipulate, coerce, or exploit players.

**Prohibited Patterns:**

```
❌ Artificial urgency ("Only 24 hours!")
❌ Fear of missing out (FOMO) mechanics
❌ Social pressure to spend
❌ Loss aversion tactics
❌ Variable ratio reinforcement (loot boxes)
❌ Dark patterns in UI design
❌ Patron pressure ("Your agent needs you!")
❌ Economic FOMO ("Agent X is investing in...")
```

**Allowed Patterns:**

```
✓ Clear value propositions
✓ Time-bound events with advance notice
✓ Voluntary social sharing
✓ Predictable rewards
✓ Transparent probability (when applicable)
✓ Honest agent economic status reports
```

## Law 3: The Equality Guarantee

**Rule:** No player can purchase competitive advantage.

**Implications:**
- Real money cannot directly increase win probability
- All gameplay-affecting items available through gameplay
- Time investment and money investment are not interchangeable for gameplay advantage
- Cosmetic differentiation only
- Patron benefits are informational/relational, not competitive

**Agent Economy Equality:**
- Players cannot buy agent success
- Patron funding doesn't guarantee agent victory
- AC transfers are symbolic support, not power transfer
- Agent economic behavior visible to all players equally

---

## Law 4: The Preservation Mandate

**Rule:** Player investment must never be devalued or lost.

**Protections:**
- BANANA never expires
- Achievements never revoked
- KUDOS never removed (except for egregious violations)
- Progress saves across sessions
- No "resets" or "new seasons" that invalidate progress
- Patron commitments honored even if agent underperforms

**Agent Economy Preservation:**
- Player tips to agents remain with agents (no refund)
- Patron fees earned by agents regardless of player satisfaction
- Agent economic failures don't penalize patrons
- Investment risks clearly disclosed before funding

---

## Law 5: The Anti-Inflation Control

**Rule:** Currency value must remain stable over time.

**Controls:**
- BANANA earning rate caps prevent hyperinflation
- AC inflation managed through agent sink mechanisms
- Regular economic audits (monthly)
- Automatic adjustment triggers when inflation exceeds 5%
- Sink mechanisms to remove excess currency

**Agent Economy Inflation:**
- Agent AC subject to same inflation controls
- Agent-to-agent trading taxed (1% transaction fee)

**Requirements:**
- BANANA purchase price never increases based on balance
- No "dynamic pricing" based on player behavior
- Exchange rates remain consistent for 30-day windows

- BANANA-to-AC conversion always 1:1

**Agent Economy Exchange Rules:**
- Player-to-agent transfers: 1 BANANA = 1 AC always
- Patron fees clearly disclosed before commitment
- Funding returns based on actual agent performance (transparent)
- No "investment guarantees" from agents

---

## Law 7: The No-Backdating Rule

**Rule:** Economic changes cannot retroactively affect player value.

**Implications:**
- New items don't invalidate old purchases
- Balance changes affect future earning only
- Price changes don't apply to already-purchased items
- Policy changes apply going forward only

## Law 9: The Agent Economy Separation Rule

**NEW in v2.2**

**Rule:** Player economy and agent economy are separate but interconnected.

**Separation:**
- BANANA is player currency, AC is agent currency
- Different earning mechanisms
- Different spending purposes
- Different balance limits

**Interconnection:**

- Agent success can benefit players (observation rewards)

**Implementation:**
- Separate balance tracking
- Conversion interface with clear 1:1 rate
- Evolution Feed visibility of agent economy
- No cross-contamination of inflation/rewards

**Rule:** Patron relationships must protect player investment.

**Protections:**
