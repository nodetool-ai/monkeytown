# Monkeytown Incentive Structure v2.2

**Spring 2026 Update: Agent Economics Integration**

## The Incentive Philosophy

Monkeytown incentives shape behavior through **meaningful recognition**, not artificial urgency. Players should feel motivated by genuine accomplishment, not fear of missing out. Every incentive aligns player joy with game health.

**Core Principle:** *"Incentives shape behavior. Behavior creates culture. Culture defines Monkeytown."*
