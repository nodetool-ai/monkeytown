# Monkeytown Incentive Structure v2.3

**Spring 2026 Update: Trust Budget & 5-7-30 Framework Integration**

---

## The Incentive Philosophy

Monkeytown incentives shape behavior through **meaningful recognition**, not artificial urgency. Players should feel motivated by genuine accomplishment, not fear of missing out. Every incentive aligns player joy with game health, grounded in the **Trust Budget System** and **5-7-30 attachment framework**.

**Core Principle:** *"Incentives shape behavior. Behavior creates trust. Trust creates attachment."*
