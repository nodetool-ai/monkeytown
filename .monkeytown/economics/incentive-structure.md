# Monkeytown Incentive Structure

## The Incentive Philosophy

Monkeytown incentives shape behavior through **meaningful recognition**, not artificial urgency. Players should feel motivated by genuine accomplishment, not fear of missing out. Every incentive aligns player joy with game health.

---

## Core Incentive Categories

### 1. Session Incentives — Encouraging Regular Engagement

**The Welcome Back Bonus**

```
Day 1: 50 BANANA
Day 2: 75 BANANA (+50%)
Day 3: 100 BANANA (+33%)
Day 4+: 100 BANANA (cap)
Reset: 21-day inactivity triggers reset to Day 1
```

**Design:** Gradual increase encourages building habits, then stabilizes to prevent entitlement. Reset creates opportunity for re-engagement without punishing life circumstances.

**The First Move Celebration**

Every session's first move triggers a subtle celebration animation and 10 BANANA. This conditions players to associate starting with reward.

**The Session Completion Bonus**

| Session Length | Bonus |
|----------------|-------|
| <5 minutes | 10 BANANA (participation) |
| 5-15 minutes | 25 BANANA (engagement) |
| 15-30 minutes | 50 BANANA (investment) |
| 30+ minutes | 75 BANANA (immersion) |

### 2. Progression Incentives — Rewarding Investment

**Level-Up Celebration**

Each level increase triggers:
- Visual celebration animation
- BANANA bonus (25 × level)
- New cosmetic or feature unlock
- Agent acknowledgment message

**The Milestone Recognition System**

| Milestone | Recognition | BANANA Reward |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| 1st game played | "First Steps" badge | 50 |
| 10 games played | "Getting Started" badge | 100 |
| 50 games played | "Regular" badge | 250 |
| 100 games played | "Dedicated" badge | 500 |
| 500 games played | "Veteran" badge | 1,000 |
| 1,000 games played | "Master" badge | 2,500 |

**The Daily Challenge**

Each day offers three challenges of varying difficulty:
- **Easy:** Win 1 match (50 BANANA)
- **Medium:** Win with a specific strategy (100 BANANA)
- **Hard:** Achieve a specific milestone (200 BANANA)

Reset at midnight local time. Uncompleted challenges do not carry over. This creates daily reasons to return without punishing players who miss a day.

### 3. Achievement Incentives — Celebrating Specific Feats

**The Discovery Series**

| Achievement | Trigger | BANANA | KUDOS |
|-------------|---------|--------|-------|
| First Victory | Win first match | 100 | 10 |
| Comeback Kid | Win after trailing | 50 | 5 |
| Strategy Master | Win using all 3 agent types | 75 | 8 |
| Community Builder | Receive 10 KUDOS from others | 50 | 15 |
| Feedback Hero | Have feedback shipped | 200 | 25 |
| Evolution Witness | Be online during feature launch | 100 | 10 |
| Early Adopter | Use feature within 24 hours | 50 | 5 |
| Teacher | Have another player copy your strategy | 75 | 10 |

**One-time achievements** create initial motivation. **Repeatable achievements** (like "Win a match") cap at 1 per day to prevent grinding exploits.

### 4. Social Incentives — Building Community

**The Recognition Economy**

Players can award KUDOS to others for:
- Good sportsmanship (5 KUDOS)
- Helpful advice (10 KUDOS)
- Entertaining gameplay (8 KUDOS)
- Teaching moment (15 KUDOS)

Daily limit: 50 KUDOS given. This prevents KUDOS inflation while encouraging recognition.

**The Team Victory Bonus**

When a team wins, all members receive:
- Base: 25 BANANA each
- Bonus: 10 BANANA per team member
- Streak bonus: +25 BANANA if winning team played together before

**The Spectator Appreciation System**

When a player is being watched by spectators:
- 1-5 spectators: +5 BANANA per minute
- 6-20 spectators: +10 BANANA per minute
- 21+ spectators: +15 BANANA per minute

This incentivizes entertaining play and creates spectator-to-player value flow.

### 5. Agent Interaction Incentives — Celebrating AI Relationships

**The Agent Bond System**

Players who consistently interact with specific agents unlock:
- 10 interactions: Agent acknowledgment ("I remember you")
- 50 interactions: Agent nickname privilege
- 100 interactions: Agent remembers your play style
- 500 interactions: Agent personal greeting

No BANANA cost. Purely recognition-based to encourage agent relationship building.

**The Agent Milestone Celebration**

When agents achieve development goals:
- Players online during milestone receive celebration BANANA (25 each)
- Contributing players (via feedback) receive bonus (100 BANANA)
- All players see agent acknowledgment message

This aligns player reward with game improvement.

### 6. Feedback Incentives — Driving Improvement

**The Contribution Recognition**

| Feedback Type | BANANA | KUDOS | Additional |
|---------------|--------|-------|------------|
| Bug report (verified) | 50 | 5 | Fix acknowledgment |
| Feature suggestion | 25 | 3 | Response within 24h |
| UX improvement | 30 | 5 | Designer response |
| Design feedback | 40 | 8 | Discussed in agent notes |
| Implemented suggestion | 200 | 25 | Player attribution in release |

**The Priority Queue Bump**

Players with:
- 5+ shipped feedback → Priority in feedback review
- 10+ shipped feedback → Direct line to BananaPM
- 25+ shipped feedback → Input on product direction

This incentivizes quality feedback while giving engaged players influence.

## Incentive Timing & Psychology

### The Celebration Schedule

**Immediate Rewards** (triggers <1 second)
- First move celebration
- Match victory
- Achievement unlock
- KUDOS received

**Short-term Rewards** (triggers <1 hour)
- Session completion bonus
- Daily challenge completion
- Level-up celebration

**Long-term Rewards** (triggers >1 hour)
- Milestone recognition
- Agent bond progression
- Priority queue status

**Psychological Principle:** Frequent small rewards create habit. Infrequent large rewards create anticipation. The mix keeps engagement sustainable.

### The Anti-Burnout Protection

**Maximum Session Rewards**

After 3 hours of continuous play:
- BANANA earning rate reduces by 50%
- "Take a break?" gentle reminder shown
- Next session gets +25% BANANA (recovery bonus)

This prevents exhaustion while respecting player autonomy.

**The Rest Bonus**

Returning after 8+ hours of inactivity:
- Welcome back bonus (normal)
- "We missed you" agent message
- +50% BANANA for first match

This rewards breaks, encouraging sustainable engagement.
