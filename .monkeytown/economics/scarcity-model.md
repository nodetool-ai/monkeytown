# Monkeytown Scarcity Model

## The Abundance Philosophy

Monkeytown embraces **intentional scarcity**, not artificial scarcity. Items are scarce because they are meaningful, not because manipulation requires it. Every scarcity decision serves player joy, not engagement metrics.

## Scarcity Categories

### Category 1: Time-Locked Scarcity

**Definition:** Items available only during specific windows, then never again.

**Implementation:**
- Limited-time events (always 14+ days advance notice)
- Seasonal items (available every year, same time)
- Anniversary items (one-time, never returns)

**The No-FOMO Guarantee:**
- All limited items clearly marked with end date
- No "surprise" availability windows
- Future availability communicated 30 days in advance
- Missed items never return (creates genuine scarcity)

**Approved Time-Locked Items:**
| Item Type | Frequency | Advance Notice |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Event cosmetics | Monthly | 14 days |
| Seasonal items | Quarterly | 30 days |
| Anniversary items | Annual | 60 days |
| Milestone celebrations | As earned | Immediate |

### Category 2: Effort-Locked Scarcity

**Definition:** Items require significant investment to obtain.

**Implementation:**
- High BANANA costs for prestigious cosmetics
- Multi-step achievement chains
- Long-term community goals
- Skill-based unlocks

**Effort Scale:**
```
Easy (1-2 hours)     → 200-500 BANANA
Medium (1-3 days)    → 500-1,500 BANANA
Hard (1-2 weeks)     → 1,500-3,000 BANANA
Expert (1+ month)    → 3,000-5,000 BANANA
Legendary (ongoing)  → Limited by sustained effort
```

### Category 3: Achievement-Locked Scarcity

**Definition:** Items earned through specific accomplishments.

**Implementation:**
- Victory milestones
- Community contributions
- Feedback shipped
- Beta testing participation

**Achievement Unlocks:**
| Achievement | Requirement | Reward |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| First Steps | Complete first game | Starter cosmetic |
| Century Club | Win 100 matches | Century badge |
| Community Pillar | Receive 500 KUDOS | Pillar cosmetic |
| Feedback Hero | Have 10 suggestions shipped | Hero badge |

### Category 4: Reputation-Locked Scarcity

**Definition:** Items available only to players with established reputation.

**Implementation:**
- KUDOS thresholds for exclusive cosmetics
- Founder's Pass benefits for supporters
- Beta access for engaged testers
- Pioneer status for early adopters

**Reputation Tiers:**
| Tier | KUDOS Required | Exclusive Access |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| Newcomer | 0+ | Basic items |
| Contributor | 100+ | Contributor cosmetics |
| Recognized | 500+ | Early feature access |
| Esteemed | 1,000+ | Beta features |
| Legendary | 5,000+ | Pioneer cosmetics |
| Pioneer | 10,000+ | Direct agent input |

### Category 5: Genuine Scarcity (Rare Materials)

**Definition:** Items that are mathematically rare by design.

**Implementation:**
- Drop rates clearly displayed
- No "pity mechanics" that create false scarcity
- True randomness with transparent probability
- No manipulation to extend engagement

**Approved Random Drops:**
| Drop Type | Rate | Guaranteed By |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| Celebration bonus | 5% per session | N/A (bonus only) |
| Rare cosmetic drop | 1% | 50 attempts |
| Legendary item | 0.1% | 200 attempts |

**Note:** "Guaranteed by" means maximum attempts before guaranteed drop. This prevents endless grinding while maintaining rarity.

## Anti-Scarcity Measures

### Abundance Principles

**Principle 1: Accessibility**
- All gameplay-affecting content available without scarcity
- Core experience complete without purchases
- No paywalls for features

**Principle 2: Comprehensiveness**
- Collection completeness achievable without spending
- Every cosmetic available through multiple paths
- No "only available through purchase" items

**Principle 3: Permanence**
- Earned items never revoked
- Cosmetics permanent once earned
- Achievements forever displayed

**Principle 4: Transparency**
- Drop rates clearly displayed
- Scarcity rationale explained
- No hidden scarcity mechanics

## Scarcity Economics

### Supply Control Mechanisms

**BANANA Supply:**
- Maximum balance: 100,000 BANANA
- Soft cap warning: 80,000 BANANA
- Sink mechanisms activate above 80,000
- Inflation target: 2-3% annually

**KUDOS Supply:**
- No maximum balance
- Daily give limit: 50 KUDOS
- Prevents KUDOS farming
- Encourages genuine recognition

**Cosmetic Supply:**
- Unlimited for most items
- Limited for:
  * Event items (once per event)
  * Anniversary items (never repeats)
  * Community milestone items (one-time only)

### Demand Management

**Healthy Demand Indicators:**
- 40-60% of players have partially completed collections
- 10-20% have near-complete collections
- 5-10% have complete collections
- No hoarding above 80,000 BANANA

**Unhealthy Demand Indicators:**
- <20% engagement with cosmetics
- >50% players at max BANANA
- >80% collection completion by <5% players

**Interventions for Unhealthy Demand:**
| Symptom | Intervention |
|---------|-------------|
| Low cosmetic engagement | New cosmetic designs |
| High BANANA hoarding | Limited-time cosmetic rush |
| Uneven collection | Target low-completion players |

## Scarcity Principles

1. **Intentionality** — Scarcity serves purpose, not manipulation
2. **Transparency** — All scarcity visible and explained
3. **Fairness** — All players have equal access paths
4. **Permanence** — Earned scarcity remains earned
5. **Respect** — Players deserve honesty about value
