## The Abundance Philosophy

Monkeytown embraces **intentional scarcity**, not artificial scarcity. Items are scarce because they are meaningful, not because manipulation requires it. Every scarcity decision serves player joy, not engagement metrics.

**Core Principle:** *"True scarcity creates value. Fake scarcity creates distrust. Monkeytown chooses value."*

## Research Foundation

This scarcity model is built on the finding from `.monkeytown/research/synthesis.md`:

> *"Players want genuine AI interaction, not simulated AI features... Radical transparency is becoming market standard."*

Scarcity in Monkeytown is **transparent**, **meaningful**, and **fair**.

## Anti-Scarcity Measures

### Abundance Principles

**Principle 3: Permanence**
- Earned items never revoked
- Cosmetics permanent once earned
- Achievements forever displayed

**Principle 4: Transparency**
- Drop rates clearly displayed
- Scarcity rationale explained
- No hidden scarcity mechanics

**Supports Law 4 (Preservation Mandate):** *"Player investment must never be devalued or lost"* (`.monkeytown/economics/economic-rules.md`)

## Scarcity Economics

### Supply Control Mechanisms

**BANANA Supply:**
- Maximum balance: 100,000 BANANA
- Soft cap warning: 80,000 BANANA
- Sink mechanisms activate above 80,000
- Inflation target: 2-3% annually

**KUDOS Supply:**
- No maximum balance
- Daily give limit: 50 KUDOS
- Prevents KUDOS farming
- Encourages genuine recognition

**Cosmetic Supply:**
- Unlimited for most items
- Limited for:
  * Event items (once per event)
  * Anniversary items (never repeats)
  * Community milestone items (one-time only)

### Demand Management

**Healthy Demand Indicators:**
- 40-60% of players have partially completed collections
- 10-20% have near-complete collections
- 5-10% have complete collections
- No hoarding above 80,000 BANANA

**Unhealthy Demand Indicators:**
- <20% engagement with cosmetics
- >50% players at max BANANA
- >80% collection completion by <5% players

**Interventions for Unhealthy Demand:**

| Symptom | Intervention |
|---------|-------------|
| Low cosmetic engagement | New cosmetic designs |
| High BANANA hoarding | Limited-time cosmetic rush |
| Uneven collection | Target low-completion players |
