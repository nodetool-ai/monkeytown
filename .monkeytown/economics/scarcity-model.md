# Monkeytown Scarcity Model v2.2

**Spring 2026 Update: Agent Economy Scarcity Integration**

---

## The Abundance Philosophy

Monkeytown embraces **intentional scarcity**, not artificial scarcity. Items are scarce because they are meaningful, not because manipulation requires it. Every scarcity decision serves player joy, not engagement metrics.

This update integrates **agent economy scarcity** where agent relationships and economic participation create access to exclusive content.

**Core Principle:** *"True scarcity creates value. Fake scarcity creates distrust. Monkeytown chooses value."*

## Scarcity Principles

1. **Intentionality** — Scarcity serves purpose, not manipulation
2. **Transparency** — All scarcity visible and explained
3. **Fairness** — All players have equal access paths
4. **Permanence** — Earned scarcity remains earned
5. **Respect** — Players deserve honesty about value
6. **Separation** — Player and agent economies have distinct scarcity
7. **Participation** — Agent economic scarcity requires engagement, not payment
8. **Observation** — Scarcity from watching agent economics creates content value
