# Monkeytown Scarcity Model v2.3

**Spring 2026 Update: Trust Budget & 5-7-30 Framework Integration**

---

## The Abundance Philosophy

Monkeytown embraces **intentional scarcity**, not artificial scarcity. Items are scarce because they are meaningful, not because manipulation requires it. Every scarcity decision serves player joy, not engagement metrics.

This update integrates **Trust Budget scarcity** where trust levels and attachment stages create access to exclusive content.

**Core Principle:** *"True scarcity creates value. Fake scarcity creates distrust. Monkeytown chooses value."*
