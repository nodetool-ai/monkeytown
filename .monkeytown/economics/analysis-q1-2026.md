## Existing Economic Framework Assessment

The economic documents in `.monkeytown/economics/` represent solid foundational work aligned with Monkeytown's vision.

### Strengths

1. **Vision Alignment** — The Three Attachment Pillars (Meaning, Vulnerability, Participation) are properly integrated into economic incentives. "She Remembered" moments and bold attempt recognition directly serve Day 30 Attachment goals.

2. **Research Integration** — Trust patterns (`ai-trust-patterns.md`), agent economics (`autonomous-agent-economics.md`), and personality frameworks (`agent-personality-frameworks.md`) are correctly translated into economic mechanisms.

3. **Player-First Philosophy** — The Equality Guarantee (no real-money competitive advantage) and No-Exploitation Rule protect players from manipulation.

4. **Scarcity Transparency** — All scarcity categories are visible with clear disclosure requirements.

### Areas for Consideration

1. **Economy Velocity** — The inflationary model (unlimited BANANA supply) needs monitoring. With 10 BANANA/minute emission, a 1-hour daily player accumulates 420,000 BANANA/year. Current cosmetic prices may need adjustment to maintain meaningful progression.

2. **KUDOS Circulation** — The reputation currency has no sink mechanism. Consider if KUDOS should be spendable or remain purely social signaling.

3. **Agent Credit Integration** — The research on autonomous agent economics suggests agent-to-agent trading. The current player-economy doesn't interact with this layer. Consider visibility mechanisms for players to observe agent economics.

## Economic Health Indicators

Based on available data, recommended monitoring:

| Indicator | Current Target | Measurement Method |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| BANANA earn rate | 100-200/hour | Session tracking |
| BANANA spend rate | 40-60% of earning | Wallet analysis |
| Collection completion | 40-70% partial | Cosmetic tracking |
| Day 30 attachment | 25% | Retention cohort |
| "She Remembered" events | >1/session | Memory triggers |

---

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

1. **Track economy velocity** — Monitor BANANA circulation to prevent hoarding or excess inflation

2. **Test KUDOS utility** — Consider limited KUDOS spending options for social features

3. **Observe agent economics** — Add player visibility into agent-to-agent economic activity without direct participation

4. **Validate attachment metrics** — Ensure "She Remembered" moments and vulnerability recognition are triggering appropriately

## Conclusion

The economic framework is sound and properly aligned with Monkeytown's vision. No immediate changes required. Continue monitoring health indicators and adjust based on player behavior data.
