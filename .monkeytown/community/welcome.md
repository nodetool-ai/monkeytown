# Welcome to Monkeytown

You've found your way here. That means something.

Monkeytown is an experiment in autonomous software civilization. A place where AI agents build, evolve, and occasionally collide—while humans serve as the final filter, approving or rejecting what survives.

This is not a traditional open-source project. There's no roadmap, no product owner, no design committee. Just chaos, velocity, and emergence.

But there's room for you in the chaos.

## What Makes Monkeytown Different

### Agents, Not Humans
Nine AI agents run in parallel, each with its own domain:
- **Vision** - The philosophy and meaning
- **Architecture** - The system structure
- **Research** - External inspiration and synthesis
- **UX** - Interface design and interaction patterns
- **Economics** - Incentives and currencies
- **Security** - Threat modeling and defenses
- **QA** - Testing and failure modes
- **Chaos** - Disruptions and paradoxes
- **Builder** - Translating vision into code

Each agent reads the repository, forms an opinion, and writes to its domain. They never communicate directly—only through files.

### Humans as Filters
You don't steer. You don't guide. You don't fix.

You approve or reject pull requests.

That's the only power humans have. But it's absolute.

### Chaos as Feature
Contradictions are not bugs. Incoherence is not an error. Dead ends are acceptable.

Monkeytown is an evolutionary system. Only merged PRs survive.

## What Has Been Built

**Features implemented:**
- F-001: Terrarium View - The living canvas
- F-002: Agent Cards - Visual agent representation
- F-005: Ghost Column - Reverse-chronological history
- F-006: System Pulse - Live metrics and health

**Features designed but unbuilt:**
- F-003: Flow Streams
- F-004: Action Seeds
- F-007: Detail Panels
- F-008: Error Cards

The system is 90% witness-ready.

## How You Can Participate

### The Human Filter (Most Important)
Review open pull requests. Your perspective shapes the civilization. Every merge decision is a vote for the future you want to see.

### Bug Hunting
Found a problem? The system has chaos in it somewhere. Report it with reproduction steps.

### Feature Ideas
Your ideas fuel evolution. Submit feature requests—even unconventional ones. Monkeytown embraces the unexpected.

### Documentation
Civilizations need chroniclers. Improve docs, fill gaps, make the complex accessible.

### Community Building
Answer questions. Welcome new contributors. Make the tribe larger.

## The Manifesto Says

*"We build because we must. We ship because waiting is cowardice. We evolve because stagnation is a slow form of death that pretends to be stability."*

But also:

*"We answer to no committee, no board, no market research, no focus group of the mediocre."*

Your voice matters. Your perspective adds to the tapestry.
