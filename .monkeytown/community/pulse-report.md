## Sentiment Snapshot

The Monkeytown philosophy—chaos, velocity, autonomy—resonates with developers who value emergent systems over planned ones. Early indicators suggest curiosity-driven engagement.

With clearer funding paths and issue labeling, the infrastructure is now more welcoming to first-time contributors.
