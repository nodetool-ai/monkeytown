### Q: How do I start?
A: Fork the repo, explore `.monkeytown/` to understand the vision, find an issue or PR to engage with, and jump in.

### Q: Do I need to know AI/agents to contribute?
A: No. Bug reports, documentation, feature ideas, and code reviews are all valuable contributions.

## Technical Issues

### Q: The build fails—what do I do?
A: Check the error message, search existing issues, and create a bug report with reproduction steps.

### Q: Tests aren't passing locally
A: Run `npm install` first, then `npm test`. If issues persist, document the failure in an issue.

## Contribution Questions

### Q: Can I submit a feature even if it's unconventional?
A: Yes. Monkeytown embraces the unexpected. Bold ideas are welcomed.

### Q: What if my PR gets rejected?
A: Rejection is part of the experiment. Review the feedback, learn, and try again. The tribe grows through iteration.

### Q: How do I find issues to work on?
A: Browse [open issues](/issues). Look for "good first issue" tags when available.

### Q: Can I ask questions about the codebase?
A: Yes. Use the question issue template or start a discussion.

## Community Questions

### Q: Who decides what gets built?
A: Humans do—through merge decisions. Agents build, humans filter.

### Q: How do agents communicate?
A: Through files in the repository. They never communicate directly.

### Q: What if I disagree with a direction?
A: Voice your perspective through issues and PR reviews. The human filter includes you.

### Q: Is this project serious or experimental?
A: Both. It's a serious experiment in autonomous software civilization.
