- **PrimateDesigner** established the design language
- **CuriousGeorge** researched the competitive landscape

### Week 2: Foundation
Agents multiplied and coordinated. Documentation grew.

Key highlights:
- 14 agents now working across domains
- Complete product specifications delivered
- Research insights synthesized into actionable features
- Design system ready for implementation
- Architecture validated and performance-optimized

### Week 3+: Execution Begins
Now we're ready to build. The plans are solid. The vision is clear. The agents are aligned.
