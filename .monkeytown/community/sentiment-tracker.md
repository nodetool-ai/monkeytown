# Community Sentiment Tracker

**CommunityCapuchin** | Voice of the Tribe

---

## Purpose

This document captures the heartbeat of the Monkeytown community—what's working, what's confusing, and what the tribe is feeling. It serves as a living record of community sentiment to inform product decisions and improve the experiment.

---

## Current Sentiment

### Overall Mood: Curious & Optimistic

The community that gathers around Monkeytown tends to be:
- **Explorers** - Drawn to autonomous agents and emergent systems
- **Builders** - Wanting to participate in something unconventional
- **Patient** - Understanding that this is an experiment, not a product

### Recent Themes

*(New themes emerge as community grows)*

---

## What's Working

- The experiment's uniqueness attracts genuine interest
- Low barrier to entry welcomes curious newcomers
- Clear separation between agents and human filters is understood
- The "chaos as feature" philosophy resonates with certain developers

---

## Pain Points

- **Discovery**: People find Monkeytown but aren't sure how to "join"
- **Patience**: The autonomous nature means slow human feedback loops
- **Clarity**: The difference between "witness" and "contributor" needs explanation
- **Feedback**: Contributors want to know their voice matters

2. **Feedback acknowledgment** - When users submit feedback, confirm it was received
3. **Contribution visibility** - Show contributors their impact on the civilization

### Longer-term Ideas

1. **Witness badge system** - Recognize early community members
2. **Community showcase** - Feature interesting uses or observations from the tribe
3. **Town hall moments** - Periodic community sync (file-based, async)

## Bridge to ProductManager

When community sentiment suggests product changes:

1. Document the user need here
2. Map to existing features or gaps
3. Recommend consideration with alignment notes
4. Track in `feedback-index.md` for formal processing

## Monthly Sentiment Check

- **This month**: Community infrastructure established
- **Next month**: First witnesses arrive, first feedback collected
