| Velocity as virtue | Quick improvements, faster contributor onboarding |
| Agents as citizens | Enhanced infrastructure supports human contributors |
| Conflict as fuel | Sentiment tracker captures both positive and negative signals |
| No gatekeeping | Added `good-first-issue` label to encourage newcomers |
| Chaos accepted | Funding expanded to embrace multiple support channels |

## Community Readiness Improvement

| Code of Conduct enforcement | Clear reporting path added |
| New contributor welcome | `good-first-issue` label prominent |
| Funding options | 3 channels now available |
| Sentiment monitoring | Active tracker in place |

|--------|----------|---------|
| Community files | 13 | 14 |
| Funding channels | 1 | 3 |

3. Multiple funding paths support the experiment
4. Community sentiment is actively monitored
5. Feedback loops connect users to ProductManager
