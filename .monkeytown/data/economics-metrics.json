## Key Metrics

### Currency Supply

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Total Supply | 1,000,000 m🍌 | Fixed, cannot be modified |
| Decimal Precision | 0.001 m🍌 | Millibanana |
| Agent Ceiling | 100,000 m🍌 | Per agent |
| Witness Ceiling | 50,000 m🍌 | Per witness |
| Burn Rate | 0.1% | On transfers > 10,000 m🍌 |

### Incentive Mechanisms

| Type | Multiplier | Condition |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Efficiency Bonus | 1.5× | Top 10% of agents by output |
| Novelty Premium | 3× | First occurrence of behavior |
| Cooperation Bonus | 1.1× | Multi-participant actions |
| Success Rate | 0.5-1.5× | Based on historical success |
| Observation Trickle | 1 m🍌/10min | Passive income for watching |

### Scarcity Limits

| Limit | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Max Flows/Agent | 10 | Prevent resource exhaustion |
| Max Seeds/Witness | 5 | Limit intervention |
| Max System Flows | 50 | System capacity |
| Exhaustion States | Defined | Agent/Witness/System |

### Circulation Metrics (When Implemented)

| Metric | Healthy Range | Current |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Circulation Velocity | 2.0-5.0 | NOT MEASURED |
| Transfer Volume/24h | Variable | NOT MEASURED |
| Average Flow Value | Variable | NOT MEASURED |
| Burn Rate/24h | Variable | NOT MEASURED |

## Slot System

The slot system manages agent capacity:

```
10 slots per agent
Priority queue for overflow
Adaptive rate limits with noise
Priority degradation on exhaustion
```

## Economic Rules (Immutable)

1. **Supply Cap**: 1,000,000 m🍌 - cannot be modified
2. **Ceiling Enforcement**: Prevents monopolization
3. **Atomic Transfers**: No partial transactions
4. **Event Immutability**: Ghost column is authoritative
5. **Observable Economics**: No hidden state
6. **7-Day Cooling**: Parameter changes require 7 days

## Implementation Requirements

| Component | Status | Priority |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Banana Ledger | NOT BUILT | P0 |
| Reward Distributor | NOT BUILT | P0 |
| Slot Manager | NOT BUILT | P0 |
| Transfer API | NOT BUILT | P0 |
| Rate Limiter | NOT BUILT | P1 |

## Alignment with Other Domains

| Domain | Alignment | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Architecture | ✅ | Slot system aligns with 50-flow limit (F-003) |
| Features | ✅ | Seed economics aligns with F-004 cost implications |
| Product | ✅ | Reward structure aligns with feature priorities |
| Vision | ✅ | Scarcity and competition align with chaos-as-fuel |

## Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Deflation spiral | MEDIUM | Time-decay efficiency, burn mechanism |
| Speculative accumulation | MEDIUM | 1% monthly passive decay on inactive |
| Incentive blindness | LOW | Incentives are attractors, not controllers |
| Scarcity gaming | LOW | Adaptive rate limits with noise |
