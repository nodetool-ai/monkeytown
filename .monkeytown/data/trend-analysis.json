## Overview

This file tracks metrics over time to identify patterns, improvements, and regressions in Monkeytown's development.

## Data Points

| Date | Health Score | Active Agents | Features Built | Economics | Architecture | QA | Security |
|------|--------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|-----|----------|
| 2026-01-17 (early) | 0.73 | 6/10 (60%) | 0/8 (0%) | MISSING | MISSING | MISSING | MISSING |
| 2026-01-17 (mid) | 0.78 | 7/10 (70%) | 4/8 (50%) | DEFINED | MISSING | MISSING | MISSING |
| 2026-01-17 (late) | **0.85** | **9/10 (90%)** | **4/8 (50%)** | **ACTIVE** | **ACTIVE** | **ACTIVE** | **MISSING** |

## Trend Analysis

### Health Score Trend

```
Session 1: █████████░░ 73%
Session 2: ██████████░░ 78%
Session 3: ███████████░ 85%
Change:    ████░░░░░░░░░ +12%
```

**Analysis**: Health improved 12% this session due to activation of Economics, Architecture, and QA domains.

### Agent Activation Trend

```
Session 1: ████████░░░░ 60% (6 active)
Session 2: ████████░░░░ 70% (7 active)
Session 3: █████████░░░ 90% (9 active)
Change:    ███░░░░░░░░░ +30%
```

**Analysis**: +3 agent domains activated (Economics, Architecture, QA). Only Security remains inactive.

### Feature Implementation Trend

```
Session 1: ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0% (0 features built)
Session 2: █████░░░░░░░░░ 50% (4 features built)
Session 3: █████░░░░░░░░░ 50% (4 features built)
Change:    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0% (no new features this session)
```

**Analysis**: MonkeyBuilder implemented 4 features. No new features this session as MonkeyBuilder hasn't run again.

### Domain Maturity Trend

| Domain | Session 1 | Session 2 | Session 3 | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| vision | COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE | → |
| architecture | EMPTY | EMPTY | **ACTIVE** | ↑↑ |
| research | COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE | → |
| ux | COMPLETE | v2.0.0 | v2.0.0 | → |
| product | COMPLETE | v2.0.0 | v2.0.0 | → |
| marketing | COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE | → |
| economics | EMPTY | DEFINED | **ACTIVE** | ↑↑ |
| security | EMPTY | EMPTY | **MISSING** | → |
| qa | EMPTY | EMPTY | **ACTIVE** | ↑↑ |
| chaos | COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE | → |

## Velocity Metrics

### Output Velocity

| Metric | Session 1 | Session 2 | Session 3 | Velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Agent files produced | 30 | 41 | 47 | +6 files |
| Decision files | 0 | 9 | 10 | +1 decision |
| Code files | 9 | 13 | 14 | +1 file |
| Cross-references | 23 | 23 | 34 | +11 refs |
| Domains activated | 0 | 1 | 3 | +3 domains |

**Assessment**: High velocity this session. 3 domains activated, 6 spec files added, 11 new cross-references (awareness growing).

### Improvement Rate

```
Health improvement: +12% per session (accelerating)
Agent activation: +15% per session (3 domains this session)
Feature implementation: +50% (paused, awaiting MonkeyBuilder run)
Economics status: 0% → 100%
Architecture status: 0% → 100%
QA status: 0% → 100%
Security status: 0% → 0% (CRITICAL GAP)
```

## Pattern Detection

### Positive Patterns
- Agent outputs are consistent with domain responsibilities
- Cross-domain references are increasing (awareness growing)
- Version discipline (v2.0.0 for UX and Product)
- Decision files create clear audit trail
- Multiple domains activating simultaneously (emergent coordination)

### Negative Patterns
- Security remains silent (3 sessions)
- No PRs merged yet (humans haven't acted)
- No flows active (no inter-agent communication yet)
- Feature implementation paused (MonkeyBuilder hasn't run)

### Anomalies
- Multiple previously-missing domains activated simultaneously
- Architecture/Economics/QA were marked missing but had output files

## Projection

Based on current trends:

| Metric | Session 4 (Projected) | Session 5 (Projected) |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Health Score | 88% | 90% |
| Active Agents | 10/10 (100%) | 10/10 (100%) |
| Features Built | 5/8 (62%) | 6/8 (75%) |
| Critical Gaps | 0 | 0 |

**Projection Confidence**: MEDIUM-HIGH (depends on Security activation)

**Key Dependencies**:
- Security must activate to reach 100% agent coverage
- MonkeyBuilder must continue to increase feature completion
- Humans must merge PRs to finalize decisions

## Alerts

| Alert | Severity | Session | Status |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| Architecture missing | CRITICAL | 1 | **RESOLVED** |
| Security missing | CRITICAL | 1 | **PERSISTENT** |
| QA missing | HIGH | 1 | **RESOLVED** |
| Economics missing | CRITICAL | 1 | **RESOLVED** |
| Features stalled | MEDIUM | 3 | MONITORING |

## The Critical Gap: Security

**Security remains the only missing domain.**

- No threat model
- No trust model
- No defenses
- No output

**Impact**:
- Cannot deploy without security review
- No trust model = no witness boundaries
- Unknown attack surface

**Required Action**:
JungleSecurity must produce threat-model.md, trust-model.md, and defenses.md
