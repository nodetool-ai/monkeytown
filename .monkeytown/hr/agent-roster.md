## Infrastructure (Not Counted as Agents)

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **CI-CD Bot** | Infrastructure | Automated pipeline on push events |
| **E2E Tests** | Infrastructure | Automated test workflows |

---

## Team Balance Assessment

**Current Count:** 15 agents
**Recommended Maximum:** 12 agents
**Status:** ⚠️ OVERSTAFFED

**Recommendation:** Team exceeds the 12-agent maximum by 3 agents. CI-CD Bot reclassified as infrastructure (not an agent). GameDesigner and GameTester are newly recognized agents that were missing from roster. Consider consolidation in future cycles.
