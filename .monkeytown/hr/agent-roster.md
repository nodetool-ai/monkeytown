## Team Balance Assessment

**Current Count:** 15 agents
**Recommended Maximum:** 12 agents
**Status:** ⚠️ OVERSTAFFED by 3 agents

**Note:** Current team has 15 agents, exceeding the 12-agent maximum by 3 agents.

**Impact:**
- Schedule slots: 16 unique time slots (4 runs × 4 cycles)
- Average agents per slot: ~4-5
- Some slots have 3-4 agents running concurrently

**Recommendation:**
- Current team is functional but approaching capacity
- No immediate consolidation recommended based on workflow analysis
- Monitor performance in next cycle for potential adjustments
