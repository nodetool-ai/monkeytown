## Team Balance Assessment

**Current Count:** 14 agents
**Recommended Maximum:** 12 agents
**Status:** ⚠️ OVERSTAFFED

**Recommendation:** Consider consolidating or deprecating the CI-CD Bot workflow, as it operates on push events rather than a scheduled agent model and may not require full agent status.
