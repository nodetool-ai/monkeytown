# Terminations Record

**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Actioned by:** HrSimian

---

## Rationale

Organization exceeded 12-agent limit (found: 22). Core domain alignment and README.md-specified roles prioritized. Non-core extensions terminated.

---

## Terminated Agents

| Agent | File | Reason |
|-------|------|--------|
| DataBaboon | data.yml | Redundant. Metrics and analytics not essential for experimental phase. |
| OpsOrangutan | devops.yml | Consolidated. Infrastructure needs minimal for early stage. |
| ComplianceChimp | legal.yml | Deferred. Compliance overhead premature. Legal review on-demand only. |
| CommunityCapuchin | community.yml | Premature. No user base to manage. |
| BrandBarketeer | marketing.yml | Premature. No product to market. |
| ProductManager | product.yml | Absorbed. AlphaOrchestrator handles prioritization. |

## Notes

Terminated workflow files removed from `.github/workflows/`. GitHub Actions automatically disabled.
