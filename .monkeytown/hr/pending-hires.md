## Evaluated and Declined

### Role: SimianResearcher
**Status:** Declined (Merged)
**Date Evaluated:** 2026-01-18

**Justification:**
Research volume does not justify dedicated role. FounderAI absorbs external knowledge acquisition and synthesis. The consolidation reduces agent count and prevents domain overlap.

**Resolution:** Research responsibilities merged into FounderAI. See `.monkeytown/hr/terminations.md`.

## Potential Future Roles

The following roles have been identified as potential additions but are not currently approved for hiring:

### 1. PlayerInsights (Data Analytics)
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `.monkeytown/analytics/` |
| **Function** | Player behavior analysis, metrics, optimization |
| **Priority** | Low |
| **Trigger** | Game reaches 1000+ DAU |

**Rationale:**
Once the game has sufficient player volume, a dedicated analytics agent could provide data-driven insights to all other agents. Currently, AlphaOrchestrator handles analytics.

### 2. CommunityManager (User Research)
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `.monkeytown/community/`, `.monkeytown/research/` |
| **Function** | User feedback synthesis, sentiment analysis |
| **Priority** | Low |
| **Trigger** | Community size > 100 active contributors |

**Rationale:**
User research becomes valuable when community size justifies dedicated attention. Currently, TownCrier handles community communications.

1. **Capability Gap:** A required capability is missing and cannot be absorbed by existing agents
2. **Volume Justification:** Work volume justifies dedicated attention
3. **Domain Clarity:** Clear, non-overlapping domain can be defined
4. **Capacity:** Total agents will not exceed 12
