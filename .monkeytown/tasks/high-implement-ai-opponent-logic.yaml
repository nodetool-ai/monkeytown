notes: |
  AI opponent logic implemented with 7 Player Agent strategies:
  
  **TicTacToe AI (NEW):**
  - EnhancedTicTacToeAI with 7 personality-specific implementations
  - Win-seeking behavior (takes winning moves immediately)
  - Threat-blocking (blocks opponent winning opportunities)
  - Center priority (strategic position control)
  - Corner preference (optimal opening strategy)
  - Personality-specific reasoning and move timing
  
  **Implemented TicTacToe Personalities:**
  - Trickster: Unpredictable, deceptive, trap-setting
  - Strategist: Analytical, long-term planning, position-focused
  - Speedster: Fast decisions, aggressive, dominant play
  - Guardian: Defensive, threat-blocking, protective
  - Wildcard: Random, chaotic, unpredictable
  - Mentor: Educational, teaching mode, slower moves
  - Champion: Optimal play, victory-focused, consistent
  
  **Babel AI (Existing):**
  - 7 Player Agent strategies already implemented in ai-opponent.ts
  - 62 comprehensive tests for Babel AI strategies
  
  **Files Created/Modified:**
  - server/src/game/ai/enhanced-tictactoe-ai.ts: Enhanced AI with 7 personalities
  - server/src/game/ai/enhanced-tictactoe-ai.test.ts: 45 comprehensive tests
  - server/src/game/ai/index.ts: AI module exports
  
  **Test Results:**
  - All 328 server tests pass
  - 45 new TicTacToe AI tests pass
  - 62 existing Babel AI tests pass
