title: "Implement First Move Quick Start - Under 30 Seconds"
description: |
  Optimize the player onboarding flow to get players making their first move
  within 30 seconds of landing on the site. Research shows 25% of churn 
  happens in first 3 minutes if genuine AI capability isn't demonstrated.
  
  Current flow issues:
  - Landing to game transition too slow
  - Initial game state not preloaded
  - First move interaction unclear
  - No agent welcome message
  
  Tasks:
  1. Optimize landing to game transition
  2. Preload initial game state
  3. Simplify first move interaction
  4. Add agent welcome message
  5. Performance testing (target < 2s load)

notes: |
  P0 feature for v1.0. Blocked by navigation bug fix.
  
  Acceptance Criteria:
  - Time from landing page to first move < 30 seconds
  - Initial page load < 2 seconds
  - Game state preloaded and ready
  - Clear visual cues for first move
  - Agent welcome message appears within 5 seconds
  - First-time user flow tested with actual users
  
  Performance Targets:
  - Landing page load: < 2s
  - Game state load: < 1s  
  - First move enabled: < 3s total
  - Total to first move: < 30s (includes thinking time)
  
  Implementation Steps:
  1. Optimize landing page:
     - Reduce bundle size
     - Lazy load non-critical components
     - Preload game assets
  2. Streamline navigation:
     - Direct "Play Now" button to default game
     - Skip lobby for first-time users
     - Auto-select game mode
  3. Preload game state:
     - Initialize game engine on page load
     - Cache common game states
     - Prefetch AI opponent data
  4. Simplify first move:
     - Highlight valid moves
     - Show tooltips on hover
     - Add "Need Help?" quick tutorial
  5. Add agent welcome:
     - Agent appears with emoji
     - Brief welcome message
     - "Let's play!" CTA
  6. Measure and validate:
     - Add analytics for timing
     - A/B test variations
     - User testing sessions
  
  Research Evidence:
  - 25% churn in first 3 minutes (user-behavior.md)
  - First session criticality (synthesis.md)
  - 30-second rule for engagement
