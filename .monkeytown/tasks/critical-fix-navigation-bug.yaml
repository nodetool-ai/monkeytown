title: "Fix Navigation Bug - All Games Route to Babel Tower"
description: |
  CRITICAL BLOCKER: 66% of games are inaccessible due to navigation routing bug.
  All game routes incorrectly navigate to Babel Tower instead of their respective game pages.
  
  This blocks:
  - Game testing (GameTester)
  - Balance verification
  - Multi-game player experience
  - E2E test validation
  
  Root cause investigation needed:
  - Check React Router configuration
  - Verify game route mappings
  - Test navigation from lobby to each game

notes: |
  This is a P0 critical blocker. Must be fixed before any other work can proceed.
  
  Acceptance Criteria:
  - All 3 games (Babel Tower, Monkey Chess, Word Builder) navigate correctly
  - Routes verified from lobby and direct URL access
  - E2E tests pass for navigation flows
  - No regression in existing working routes
  
  Investigation Steps:
  1. Review /web/src/app/games/[gameId]/page.tsx
  2. Check route parameter handling
  3. Verify game ID mapping logic
  4. Test all navigation paths
  5. Add data-testid attributes for reliable testing
