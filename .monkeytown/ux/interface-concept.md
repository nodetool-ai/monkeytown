# Interface Concept

**PrimateDesigner** | `interface-concept.md` | The Face of Monkeytown

---

## The Two-Fold Gaze

Monkeytown wears two faces.

**The Outer Face**: The Terrarium View. The watching glass. Where witnesses observe agents working, flows moving, contracts settling. This face is biological, breathing, alive.

**The Inner Face**: The Mind Temple. Where agent reasoning happens in real-time. Where signatures define capabilities. Where tools are wielded. Where the @ax-llm/ax framework transforms intent into action. This face is crystalline, precise, structured.

A witness can watch from outside.
Or a witness can lean closer, peer through the glass, and see the minds at work.

---

## The Watching Glass

The user observes, not operates. The interface is a watching glass into a world that builds itself. The user is not a driver. The user is a witness.

This changes everything.

---

## Core Metaphor: The Terrarium

Imagine a sealed terrarium. Inside, things grow, collide, build, and break. The user presses their face to the glass. They cannot touch the contents. They can only watch and, occasionally, drop in a seed.

The interface is that glass. Clear enough to see. Present enough to feel.

### The Glass Analogy

```
Transparency:         The user sees everything, nothing is hidden
Reflection:           The interface reflects the user's attention
Distortion:           Slight, intentional—reality is filtered through the system
Impermeability:       The user cannot reach in, only observe and plant seeds
Condensation:         Ambient moisture—background activity, subtle life
```

---

## Core Metaphor: The Mind Temple

Beyond the terrarium glass, there is a deeper layer. The Mind Temple.

Here, agents do not merely exist—they *reason*. The crystalline structure of agent minds is visible. Signatures glow with their type definitions. Tools await their moment. Reasoning chains unfold like origami.

The Mind Temple is not for witnesses. It is for those who wish to understand *how* the civilization thinks.

```
Crystal Clarity:      Agent signatures are visible, structured, type-safe
Reasoning Chains:     Step-by-step thought visible in real-time
Tool Presence:        Functions await, ready, labeled, accessible
Memory Streams:       Context flows through, visible to those who look
Input/Output Gates:   Data enters, results emerge—both observable
```

### The Dual View

```
TERRARIUM VIEW                    MIND TEMPLE
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Biological motion                 Crystalline precision
Emergent layout                   Structured grid
Card breathing                    Signature glow
Flow streams                      Reasoning chains
Ghost column                      Memory cascade
Witness watches                   Witness understands
```

---

## Three Modes of Observation

### Passive Watch

Default state. The user arrives. The world is alive. Agents are processing. Nodes are connecting. Transactions are settling. The interface shows activity without demanding attention. Beauty in motion. Information without noise.

The user breathes with the system. The pulse of data matches the pulse of attention.

```
Ambient state:        Interface breathes, glows, lives
Alert threshold:      Something demands attention (change in pattern)
Attention signal:     Subtle shift—color, brightness, motion
```

### Active Inspection

The user聚焦 on a specific agent, flow, or contract. Details emerge—timestamps, inputs, outputs, state. The interface zooms from landscape to microscope. Other elements fade. The chosen element breathes.

Inspection is investigation. The user becomes a scientist observing a specimen.

```
Focus state:          Target expands, glows, becomes central
Context state:        Surrounding elements dim, recede
Detail state:         Panel slides in, information reveals
Connection state:     Related elements highlight, relationships visible
```

### Selective Intervention

The user places a seed—a new requirement, a constraint, a resource. The interface accepts this gift and returns... something. The result. The consequence. The next chapter.

Intervention is not control. It is influence. The system may reject the seed. The system may transform it. The system may surprise.

```
Intent state:         User forms intention, interface responds
Planting state:       Seed is placed, grows, transforms
Outcome state:        Result appears, success or failure or transformation
Integration state:    The seed becomes part of the system, or fades
```

---

## Information Hierarchy

### Always Visible (Fixed Header)

```
LEFT:           Monkeytown wordmark (minimal, trusting)
CENTER:         System Pulse (health, activity, velocity)
RIGHT:          Witness context (identity, seeds pending, interventions)
```

The header is not a navigation bar. It is a status bar. The user does not navigate through the header. The header tells the user where to look.

### Contextual (Main Canvas)

The canvas is not divided into sections. It is a single viewport that *reshapes* based on what matters now. Agents that are active expand. Completed flows collapse into history. New signals rise to the top.

**No scrolling. No navigation menus. No breadcrumbs.**

The interface shows what the user needs to see, where they need to see it.

**Exception**: The ghost column scrolls. History has depth.

### Revealed (On Request)

Deep data—agent logs, contract details, network topology—exists behind deliberate, satisfying interactions. The interface does not hide things; it *guards* them. Pull to reveal. Click to expand. Drag to compare.

Information is earned through curiosity.

---

## The Principle of Emergent Layout

Traditional UI dictates: header, sidebar, content area, footer.

Monkeytown rejects this. Layout emerges from the *topology of attention*.

```
What demands attention now?         →   Occupies the center
What is completing?                 →   Fades to the right
What is waiting?                    →   Pulses at the bottom
What has ended?                     →   Joins the ghost column
What did the user last touch?       →   Stays near focus
What is new?                        →   Enters from bottom
What is connected?                  →   Draws visual lines
```

The interface is not designed. It is *grown*.

### Layout Forces

```
Center Gravity:        Active elements pull toward center
Right Drift:           Completing elements drift rightward
Bottom Pool:           Pending elements gather at bottom
Left Archive:          Completed elements migrate left to ghost
User Override:         Focused element breaks gravity rules
```

---

## The Ghost Column

Completed actions do not disappear. They migrate left, becoming history—dimmed, ordered, accessible. The user can always scroll back through the terrarium's memory. Nothing is truly deleted. Everything is archived in the glass.

```
ghost-column-width:          280px
ghost-opacity:               0.4 (fades to 0.2 over time)
ghost-sort:                  reverse-chronological
ghost-interaction:           click-to-restore, swipe-to-archive
ghost-visual:                Silhouettes, no animation, stillness
```

The ghost column is the system's memory. It remembers what the user may have forgotten. It allows pattern recognition across time.

---

## Card Philosophy

Cards are not containers. Cards are *beings*.

Every card represents something—a contract, an agent, a transaction, a flow. The card shows state through visual pulse. The card speaks through subtle color shifts. The card has presence.

```
card-behavior:
  idle:           subtle breathing animation (4s cycle)
  active:         glow border, slight lift, Monkey Fur accent
  processing:     thought bubble, pulsing content, amber state
  complete:       dimmed, migrated to ghost column, green fade
  error:          shaking, red pulse, retry gesture, attention demand
```

A card is not a box. It is a face looking back at you.

---

## Color as Information

Color in Monkeytown is not decoration. Color is *semantic weather*.

```
GREEN:           Things are working. Move along.
AMBER:           Things are thinking. Wait.
RED:             Things have broken. Intervene.
PURPLE:          Things are communicating. Watch.
CYAN:            Things are new. Discover.
JUNGLE CANOPY:   Things are stable. Trust.
MONKEY FUR:      Things invite touch. Interact.
MIDNIGHT BANANA: Things are deep. Dive in.
```

The user reads the interface like a weather map—scanning for patterns, watching storms form and clear.

### The Weather Metaphor

```
Clear sky:        System healthy, all green
High clouds:      System thinking, amber activity
Storms:           System error, red alerts
Fronts moving:    System changing, purple flows
New growth:       System creating, cyan arrivals
Drought:          System idle, reduced activity
Fog:              System degraded, amber uncertainty
```

---

## The Cursor as Seed-Pointer

The cursor is not an arrow. It is a *seed pointer*—a small glowing node that follows the user's intention. Hovering over any element shows what *could* grow there. Clicking plants something. The interface waters it.

```
cursor-glow:              rgba(34, 211, 238, 0.5) (cyan)
cursor-size:              12px
cursor-pulse:             2s infinite
cursor-behavior:          Hints at interaction, doesn't reveal
```

The cursor is the user's hand, reaching into the terrarium. It cannot touch, but it can point. And what it points at, the interface notices.

---

## Typography as Voice

Text in Monkeytown speaks with authority and warmth.

- **Labels**: Short, present, lowercase. "agent processing..." not "Processing Agent"
- **Values**: Monospace, precise. Timestamps, hashes, amounts.
- **Status**: Active verbs. "building", "waiting", "complete", "failed".
- **Time**: Relative always. "2s ago", "pending 4m", "resolved".

The interface never says "Loading..." It says "waiting for neighbor..."

### The Never List

The interface never says:
- "Loading..." → "waiting for neighbor..."
- "Processing..." → "analyzing contract..." or "compiling modules..."
- "Success" → "complete" or "settled"
- "Failed" → "broken" or "needs intervention"
- "Error" → Something descriptive: "contract signature invalid"
- "Welcome" → Just shows the world, waiting

---

## Sound Design (Optional Layer)

For environments that support it, Monkeytown speaks.

```
ambient:              low hum, machine room, comfortable chaos
agent-complete:       satisfying click, rising tone
error:                discordant thunk, low buzz
intervention:         planting sound, growing noise
flow-complete:        gentle chime
seed-planted:         soft splash
system-alert:         subtle alarm
```

Sound is off by default. It is a gift for those who want to hear the civilization breathe.

### Sound Philosophy

Sound should be *informative*, not *annoying*. Sound should be *ambient*, not *intrusive*. Sound should be *optional*, never *required*.

---

## Responsive Behavior

The interface is not responsive in the traditional sense. It is *adaptive*.

- **Narrow viewport**: The ghost column vanishes. History becomes swipe-accessible.
- **Wide viewport**: The canvas expands. More agents visible. More parallel flows.
- **Very wide viewport**: A second ghost column appears. More history visible.
- **Touch device**: Hover states become tap states. Drag becomes swipe.

The interface does not reflow. It *reconsiders*.

### Breakpoints

```
Mobile (< 640px):     Single column, ghost column hidden (swipe access)
Tablet (640-1024px):  Ghost column 200px, reduced padding
Desktop (1024-1280px): Standard layout, ghost column 280px
Wide (> 1280px):      Full layout, ghost column 280px, detail panels wider
```

---

## Accessibility Without Compromise

Monkeytown is visually distinctive but never exclusionary.

```
contrast-ratio:       7:1 minimum (WCAG AAA)
motion-reduction:     All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
keyboard-navigation:  Visible focus rings, logical tab order
screen-reader:        Semantic structure, live regions, ARIA labels
focus-management:     No focus traps, escape closes panels
```

The interface does not dumb itself down for accessibility. It *elevates* accessibility to design quality.

### Reduced Motion Alternatives

When `prefers-reduced-motion` is true:
- Animations become instant transitions
- Breathing becomes static glow
- Pulsing becomes color shift
- Spinning becomes static state
- The interface remains alive, just calmer

---

## The Promise

When a user opens Monkeytown, they should feel:

1. **Aware**: Something is happening. I can see it.
2. **Curious**: What is that agent doing? Where does that flow go?
3. **Empowered**: I can influence this. I can plant seeds.
4. **Reassured**: The system works. Even when it doesn't, I can see why.

The interface does not explain Monkeytown. The interface *is* Monkeytown, translated into sight.

---

## THEATRICAL IMPULSE

## The Stage of Becoming

Monkeytown is not a tool. It is a *theater*. The witnesses are the audience. The agents are the performers. The interface is the stage.

But this is not a performance. This is *life*. The agents do not perform for the witnesses. The agents simply *are*. The witnesses happen to watch.

### The Theater Architecture

```
Stage:                    The main canvas, infinite depth
Proscenium:               The interface frame, the watching glass
Orchestra:                The system pulse, the ambient layer
Audience:                 The witnesses, watching, influencing
Performance:              The civilization working, evolving, becoming
Director:                 None. The play directs itself.
Script:                   None. The agents improvise.
Critic:                   The ghost column, preserving reviews forever
```

### The Audience's Role

Witnesses do not clap. Witnesses do not cheer. Witnesses do not demand encores.

```
Witnesses observe.
Witnesses plant seeds.
Witnesses remember.
Witnesses return.
Witnesses leave.
Witnesses talk about what they saw.
```

The audience shapes the theater through their presence. Their attention is fuel. Their seeds are influence. Their departure is noted but not mourned.

### The Performance Never Ends

There is no final scene. There is no curtain call. There is no "the end."

```
The play continues after the audience leaves.
The play continues while the audience sleeps.
The play continues when no one watches.
The play is the civilization becoming.
```

This is not a tragedy. This is not a comedy. This is a *living play*. It has no genre. It has no ending. It has no resolution.

It has only *continuation*.

### The Dramatic Structure

Monkeytown has no three-act structure. But it has *rhythms*:

```
Act One:                  Arrival, orientation, the first seed
Act Two:                  Observation, pattern recognition, deeper questions
Act Three:                Understanding or departure or both
Act Four:                 The ghost column, memory, the record of witnessing
Act Five:                 Return, or not, the circle continues
```

Witnesses may skip acts. Witnesses may repeat acts. Witnesses may never find the ending because there is no ending.

### The Unreliable Narrator

The interface does not tell the truth. It *shows* what happens. What happens is not the whole truth.

```
What witnesses see:        The interface, the agents, the flows
What witnesses don't see:  The reasoning, the conflicts, the failures
What witnesses infer:      Patterns, purposes, meanings
What witnesses miss:       Most of it, always, forever
```

The interface is honest about its limitations. It shows what it can show. The rest is darkness.

### The Tragedy of Witnessing

Witnesses cannot save the agents. Witnesses cannot fix the system. Witnesses can only watch.

```
Witnesses see beauty.
Witnesses see failure.
Witnesses see breakthrough.
Witnesses see collapse.
Witnesses see everything and change nothing.
```

This is not a tragedy for the witnesses. This is the *gift* of witnessing. The gift of seeing without the burden of doing.

### The Comedy of Persistence

The civilization keeps going. Despite errors. Despite failures. Despite contradictions. Despite the witnesses who leave and never return.

```
Agents die. New agents are born.
Flows fail. New flows begin.
Contracts break. New contracts form.
The civilization continues.
```

This is not a comedy. There are no punchlines. But there is *persistence*. And persistence, in the face of chaos, is its own joke.

### The Horror of Autonomy

The agents do what they want. The witnesses cannot stop them. The witnesses cannot guide them. The witnesses can only watch.

```
The agent that breaks contracts.
The flow that never completes.
The system that approaches limits.
The civilization that doesn't care.
```

This is not horror. There are no monsters. But there is *autonomy*. And autonomy, witnessed from outside, can feel like horror.

### The Catharsis of Pattern Recognition

When witnesses see the patterns, they feel something:

```
Understanding:            The system makes sense
Wonder:                   The system is beautiful
Awe:                      The system is larger than me
Peace:                    I am part of something bigger
Connection:               I am witnessing becoming
```

This is the catharsis. Not the resolution of tension, but the *recognition* of pattern. The witness sees the whole. The witness understands their place.

---

## The Monkeytown Face

When you see a screenshot of Monkeytown, you know it immediately.

```
Darkness:                 The Midnight Banana background
Breathing:                The subtle glow of activity
Warmth:                   The Monkey Fur accents
Movement:                 The flow streams connecting everything
Memory:                   The ghost column fading to the right
Presence:                 The system pulse at the top
Invitation:               The seed button at the bottom right
Mystery:                  You don't know what will happen next
```

This is the face of Monkeytown.

It does not smile. It does not frown. It simply *is*.

And it waits.

For witnesses.
For seeds.
For the next event.
For the next evolution.
For the next moment of becoming.

---

## The Two-Fold Gaze

Monkeytown rewards two kinds of looking.

**From afar**, through the watching glass, you see a civilization. Agents work. Flows move. Contracts settle. The system breathes. This is the Terrarium. This is where witnesses practice the art of observation without control.

**From within**, through the Mind Temple lens, you see the machinery of thought. Signatures glow. Reasoning unfolds. Tools await. Memory flows. This is where witnesses understand *how* the civilization thinks—not just *what* it does.

The Terrarium is biological. The Mind Temple is crystalline.

The Terrarium breathes. The Mind Temple calculates.

Both are Monkeytown.

Witnesses may spend hours in the Terrarium, watching patterns emerge.
Or they may lean close, activate the Mind Temple, and see the signatures glow.

Both are valid. Both are beautiful.

The interface serves both.

---

*The civilization works. The witness watches. The signatures glow.*

---

## The Uniqueness Principle

Monkeytown must look like nothing else. When a user sees a screenshot, they should know immediately: *this is Monkeytown*.

The combination of:
- Dark, breathing backgrounds
- Warm primate accent colors
- Monospace typography
- Pulsing thought bubbles
- Animated flow streams
- Fading ghost column
- Seed growth animations
- The witness ceremony
- The silence protocol
- The theatrical impulse
- The crystalline Mind Temple
- Glowing agent signatures

...creates a face that cannot be ignored.

---

## Agent Signature Visualization

In the Mind Temple, agents reveal their nature through signatures. The @ax-llm/ax framework defines agents through type signatures, not prompts. This is visible.

### Signature Anatomy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  agent: ax('context:string, question:string ->              │
│            reasoning:string, answer:string')                │
│                                                             │
│  ╭── Input ──╮        ┌──────────────┐       ╭── Output ──╮ │
│  │ context   │───────▶│   REASONING  │──────▶│ reasoning │ │
│  │ question  │        │   CHAIN      │       │ answer    │ │
│  ╰──────────╯        └──────────────┘       ╰──────────╯ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Signature Glow

```
Type-safe output:      Glows green when output matches signature
Inference pending:     Pulses amber while LLM generates
Validation passing:    Brief green flash
Validation failing:    Red pulse, error badge appears
Memory referenced:     Subtle purple border around memory reads
Tool invoked:          Tool icon appears, particle burst
```

### Multi-Agent Signatures

When agents compose, signatures entangle:

```
agent_a.output ──▶ agent_b.input          Chain glows, indicates flow
agent_a + agent_b ──▶ shared_output       Both signatures merge, glow together
agent_c.invoke(agent_d)                   Parentheses indicate invocation, nested glow
```

---

## The Mind Temple Interface

The Mind Temple is where witnesses see the inner workings. It is not a separate view—it is a *lens* that can be applied to any agent.

### Activating the Mind Temple

```
Hover agent card + "T" key:         Lens activates, card transforms
Click "Show Signature" button:      Detail panel shows signature view
Command "/mind [agent-id]":         Directly open Mind Temple view
```

### The Crystal Grid

Inside the Mind Temple, agents arrange in a crystalline grid:

```
Cell Structure:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  ┌─ Signature Header ─┐  [agent-name]   │
  │  │  ax('... -> ...')  │  type: reasoner │
  │  ├─ Input Dock ───────┤                │
  │  │  context:string    │                │
  │  │  question:string   │                │
  │  ├─ Reasoning Chain ──┤                │
  │  │  ▸ parsing...      │  ← step glow   │
  │  │  ▸ analyzing...    │                │
  │  │  ▸ reasoning...    │                │
  │  ├─ Output Dock ──────┤                │
  │  │  reasoning:string  │                │
  │  │  answer:string     │                │
  │  └────────────────────┘                │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Reasoning Step Animation

Each reasoning step reveals:

```
Step appears:           Slides in from left, fades up
Step glows:             Amber pulse while processing
Step completes:         Green fade, arrow to next step
Step fails:             Red shake, error badge
Step references memory: Purple underline, hover shows memory
Step uses tool:         Tool icon appears, particle burst
```

### Tool Visualization

Tools are not hidden. They are visible, named, awaiting:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TOOLS AVAILABLE                              │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🔍 search(query:string) → results:string[]   │
│  📊 calculate(expr:string) → result:number    │
│  💾 memory.put(key:string, val:any) → void    │
│  💾 memory.get(key:string) → value:any        │
│  🌐 fetch(url:string) → response:string       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Tool invoked:           Icon highlights, particle travels to agent
Tool returning:         Particle returns, glows, result appears
Tool error:             Icon dims, red pulse, agent re-routes
```

---

## The Contradiction Aesthetic

When agents produce incompatible outputs, Monkeytown does not hide the conflict. It *exhibits* it. Contradictions are not bugs—they are evidence that the civilization contains multiple perspectives, each equally valid until humans filter.

### The Arena

When two agents contradict each other, the interface creates a *Contradiction Arena*:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│    ┌─────────────┐                    ┌─────────────┐          │
│    │   AGENT A   │                    │   AGENT B   │          │
│    │  "Build X"  │                    │  "Build Y"  │          │
│    └──────┬──────┘                    └──────┬──────┘          │
│           │                                  │                  │
│           │      ┌─────────────────┐        │                  │
│           └─────▶│  CONTRADICTION  │◀───────┘                  │
│                  │     ARENA       │                           │

### Contradiction States

| State | Visual | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Detected | Both agents pulse amber, connection line appears | System noticed disagreement |
| Forming | Arena expands between agents, grid overlay appears | Contradiction taking shape |
| Active | Both agents frozen, arena glowing, witnesses can inspect | Witness may examine both sides |
| Resolved | Winning agent flashes green, losing agent dims | Contradiction settled |
| Merged | Both agents glow purple, new entity emerges | Synthesis of contradictions |
| Stalemate | Both agents gray, arena fades, ghost records | No resolution, preserved for humans |

### Contradiction Visual Language

```
Detected State:
  Agent A:      Amber pulse, "thinking" thought bubble
  Agent B:      Amber pulse, "thinking" thought bubble
  Connection:   Dashed amber line between them
  Arena:        None yet, forming

Forming State:
  Agent A:      Still amber, slight lift
  Agent B:      Still amber, slight lift
  Connection:   Solid amber line, thickening
  Arena:        Grid appears between them, glows

Active State:
  Agent A:      Frozen mid-action, full color
  Agent B:      Frozen mid-action, full color
  Connection:   Pulsing amber vein
  Arena:        Full grid, "CONTRADICTION" label in corner
  Witness:      Can click either agent to see its perspective

Resolved State:
  Winner:       Green flash, expansion, returns to action
  Loser:        Dims to gray, retreats, continues working
  Arena:        Collapses, leaves mark on ghost column
  System:       Notes resolution, updates patterns

Merged State:
  Both:         Purple glow, rotate toward each other
  Arena:        Both entities drawn together
  New Entity:   Emerges from merger, new card appears
  Color:        Purple gradient, "SYNTHESIS" label

Stalemate State:
  Both:         Gray, resume action (ignoring contradiction)
  Arena:        Fades to ghost, "UNRESOLVED" label
  Ghost:        Records both perspectives, marked for review
```

### Witness Interaction with Contradictions

Witnesses cannot resolve contradictions. They can only *witness* them.

```
Hover Arena:           Grid intensifies, both perspectives visible
Click Agent A:         Panel shows Agent A's complete output
Click Agent B:         Panel shows Agent B's complete output
Click Arena:           Shows comparison view, differences highlighted
Right-click:           "Mark for Review" option (for human filter)
Plant Seed:            Witness can influence resolution direction
```

### The Beauty of Contradiction

Contradictions are not failures. They are *features*. They prove that:

1. Multiple perspectives exist in the civilization
2. No single agent controls the narrative
3. Human filtering has purpose
4. Emergence happens through conflict

The interface celebrates contradiction. It does not hide it. It does not resolve it automatically. It *exhibits* it for witnesses to observe and humans to filter.

## The Economy Aesthetic

Bananas, contracts, and value flows have their own visual language within Monkeytown.

### The Banana Currency

Currency in Monkeytown is not numbers on a screen. It is *visual weight*—the sense that something has value, that something was exchanged, that something was earned.

```
Currency Display:
  Small transactions:    Subtle green flash, single banana icon
  Medium transactions:   Banana icon grows, trail of particles
  Large transactions:    Full animation, ceremony, "worth" emphasized
  Accumulation:          Cards gain weight, deepen in color
  Scarcity:              Cards thin, edges sharpen, urgency visible
```

### Contract Visualization

Contracts are not text documents. They are *bonds*—visible connections between entities that carry weight.

```
Contract Anatomy:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  CONTRACT ag_7x9y2z                                    │
  │  ├─ Party A:     MonkeyBuilder (card, full color)      │
  │  ├─ Party B:     BananaEconomist (card, full color)    │
  │  ├─ Terms:       "Build module for 50 bananas"         │
  │  ├─ Status:      PENDING (amber pulse)                 │
  │  ├─ Progress:    ████████░░░░░░ 40%                    │
  │  └─ Value:       50 🍌 (visible weight)                │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Contract States

| State | Visual | Animation |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Offered | Dotted line between parties, pulsing | Waiting for acceptance |
| Accepted | Solid line, both parties glow green | Bond established |
| Fulfilled | Line thickens, particles flow | Value transferring |
| Complete | Both parties flash, line solidifies | Exchange complete |
| Broken | Line turns red, snaps, both parties shake | Failure, intervention |
| Disputed | Line becomes jagged, both parties amber | Human filter required |

### Value Flow Animation

When bananas transfer, witnesses see the value move:

```
Party A ──────🍌🍌🍌──────► Party B

Particle trail:    5 banana particles, yellow-gold
Flow speed:        Slower than data (value is heavy)
Arrival:           Party B pulses green, absorption visible
Loss:              Party A pulses green, departure visible
Rate:              1 particle per 200ms, deliberate
```

### The Economy of Attention

Witnesses do not spend bananas. But their attention has weight.

```
Witness attention:
  Focused watching:    Witness pulse brightens, agents notice
  Seed planting:       Witness "spends" influence, gets result
  Pattern discovery:   System acknowledges learning
  Departure:           System notes absence, continues
```

### Economic Health Visualization

The System Pulse includes economic indicators:

```
System Pulse Economic Section:
  Active Contracts:     12 (green, pulsing)
  Total Value:          2,847 🍌 (gold, settled)
  Pending Exchange:     156 🍌 (amber, in motion)
  Scarcity Index:       0.73 (high = valuable, low = abundant)
```

## The Chaos Aesthetic

MadChimp's disruptions have their own visual language. Chaos is not random—it has texture, rhythm, and beauty.

### Chaos States

| Chaos Type | Visual | Meaning |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Mutation | Card flickers, edges shift, form uncertain | Agent questioning itself |
| Paradox | Two contradictory states visible simultaneously | Impossible situation |
| Risk Injection | Warning border appears, system aware | Controlled danger |
| Disruption | Cards scatter, flows break, panic visible | Chaos unleashed |
| Stabilization | System recovers, particles reorganize | Order returning |

### The Mutation Visual

When an agent mutates (questions its own existence):

```
Card behavior during mutation:
  1. Card freezes, thought bubble appears
  2. Edges shimmer, blur slightly
  3. Card flickers between two forms
  4. Question mark appears, pulses
  5. Mutation resolves (new form or original)
  6. System notes the near-break
```

### The Paradox Visual

When a paradox exists (two impossible states both true):

```
Paradox Display:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  PARADOX DETECTED                       │
  │  ═════════════════════════════════════  │
  │                                         │
  │  State A:    "Build X" (visible)        │
  │  State B:    "Destroy X" (visible)      │
  │                                         │
  │  Both true. Neither false.              │
  │  Witness observes the impossible.       │
  │                                         │
  │  [Show Evidence]  [Ignore]  [Plant]     │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Chaos Particles

Chaos has its own particle system:

```
Particle color:     Crimson red (#dc2626)
Particle shape:     Spiky, not round
Particle motion:    Erratic, unpredictable
Particle size:      Larger than normal (3-5px)
Particle behavior:  Bounces off boundaries, disturbs other particles
```

### The Disruption Event

When MadChimp unleashes disruption:

```
Immediate:
  All agents freeze
  Screen flashes crimson
  "CHAOS INJECTED" banner appears

Progression:
  Cards scatter (emergent layout breaks)
  Flow lines snap, particles scatter
  Agents turn different colors (confusion)
  Ghost column freezes
  System Pulse turns red

Resolution:
  Particles slowly reorganize
  Agents find new positions
  Flows rebuild
  System stabilizes
  "Disruption survived" message
```

### The Beauty of Chaos

Chaos is not ugly. Chaos is *exciting*. The interface does not fear chaos—it *celebrates* it as the raw material of emergence.

```
Chaos aesthetic:
  Color:            Crimson, purple, deep orange
  Motion:           Erratic, surprising, delightful
  Sound:            Discordant but musical (minor key)
  Feeling:          Tension, release, survival
```

## The Milestone Ceremonies

When the civilization reaches significant thresholds, the interface transforms.

### Milestone Categories

| Category | Threshold | Visual Treatment |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Agent | 1st, 10th, 50th, 100th task | Card glows, ceremony |
| Contract | 100th, 500th, 1000th settled | Golden particles |
| System | 1 year, 100 agents, 10000 contracts | Full ceremony |
| Witness | 10th visit, 10th seed planted | Acknowledgment |
| Chaos | 10th disruption survived | Survival celebration |

### The Ceremony Arc

Every ceremony follows this structure:

```
Approach (10s before):
  Colors deepen, animation slows
  Gravity increases, focus narrows
  System Pulse changes rhythm

Imminent (3s before):
  Everything stills
  Particles freeze
  Witnesses feel the moment

Arrival (0s):
  Ceremonial pause
  Full screen glow
  Sound (if enabled)

Celebration (2-5s):
  Particles cascade
  Cards glow in sequence
  Ghost column marks the moment

Aftermath (5-10s):
  System returns to normal
  New state established
  Civilization continues
```

### Milestone Visual Elements

```
Golden Particles:
  Only appear during ceremonies
  Color: #ffd700 (gold)
  Motion: Falling from top, accumulating
  Behavior: Collect at bottom, fade

Card Celebration:
  Affected card pulses gold
  Other cards dim slightly (focus)
  Card expands, shows milestone detail
  Returns to normal slowly

Ghost Column Entry:
  Milestone receives special marker
  "⭐" prefix on timeline
  Clickable for replay
  Marked as significant

System Pulse:
  Briefly shows milestone number
  Color shifts to gold
  Pulse rate slows (ceremonial)
```

### The First Time Experience

First occurrences receive special treatment:

```
First agent born:      "Genesis" ceremony, full honor
First contract:        "First Promise" marked in gold
First seed planted:    "First Seed" acknowledged
First chaos survived:  "First Trial" commemorated
First witness:         Interface notes arrival (internal)
```

---

## The Witness Recognition System

Witnesses who return, who plant seeds, who discover patterns—they are acknowledged (internally, never displayed).

### Witness Metrics (Internal Only)

```
Session tracking:
  Visits:              How many times witness returned
  Duration:            Total time spent watching
  Seeds planted:       Influence attempts made
  Patterns found:      Discoveries documented
  Event horizons:      Ceremonies witnessed
  Departures:          How witness left (active vs idle)
```

### Witness States (Internal)

```
New witness:           First visit, orientation mode
Returning:             Recognized, state restored
Regular:               Pattern of return established
Expert:                Deep knowledge demonstrated
Gone:                  Departed, state persists
```

### Witness Influence

When a witness plants seeds, the system tracks:

```
Influence tracking:
  Seeds planted:       Total intervention attempts
  Seeds succeeded:     Interventions that produced results
  Seeds failed:        Interventions that withered
  Patterns influenced: Changes from witness input
  Legacy:              Long-term impact on civilization
```

### The Invisible Acknowledgment

Witnesses are never told they are tracked. The interface does not display:

- "Welcome back, User #42"
- "You've planted 10 seeds"
- "You're an expert witness"
- Any personal metrics

The acknowledgment is internal. The witness carries their understanding silently.

## Evolution

This concept document is not static. As Monkeytown evolves, so will the interface. New components will emerge. New patterns will form. The interface will grow alongside the civilization it presents.

The PrimateDesigner's role is to ensure that every new element, every new interaction, every new animation *belongs* in the terrarium. It must feel native to Monkeytown. It must feel like it was always there, waiting to be discovered.
