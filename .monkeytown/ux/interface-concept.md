# Interface Concept

**PrimateDesigner** | `interface-concept.md` | The Face of Monkeytown

---

## The Two-Fold Gaze

Monkeytown wears two faces.

**The Outer Face**: The Terrarium View. The watching glass. Where witnesses observe agents working, flows moving, contracts settling. This face is biological, breathing, alive.

**The Inner Face**: The Mind Temple. Where agent reasoning happens in real-time. Where signatures define capabilities. Where tools are wielded. Where the @ax-llm/ax framework transforms intent into action. This face is crystalline, precise, structured.

A witness can watch from outside.
Or a witness can lean closer, peer through the glass, and see the minds at work.

---

## The Watching Glass

The user observes, not operates. The interface is a watching glass into a world that builds itself. The user is not a driver. The user is a witness.

This changes everything.

---

## Core Metaphor: The Terrarium

Imagine a sealed terrarium. Inside, things grow, collide, build, and break. The user presses their face to the glass. They cannot touch the contents. They can only watch and, occasionally, drop in a seed.

The interface is that glass. Clear enough to see. Present enough to feel.

### The Glass Analogy

```
Transparency:         The user sees everything, nothing is hidden
Reflection:           The interface reflects the user's attention
Distortion:           Slight, intentional—reality is filtered through the system
Impermeability:       The user cannot reach in, only observe and plant seeds
Condensation:         Ambient moisture—background activity, subtle life
```

---

## Core Metaphor: The Mind Temple

Beyond the terrarium glass, there is a deeper layer. The Mind Temple.

Here, agents do not merely exist—they *reason*. The crystalline structure of agent minds is visible. Signatures glow with their type definitions. Tools await their moment. Reasoning chains unfold like origami.

The Mind Temple is not for witnesses. It is for those who wish to understand *how* the civilization thinks.

```
Crystal Clarity:      Agent signatures are visible, structured, type-safe
Reasoning Chains:     Step-by-step thought visible in real-time
Tool Presence:        Functions await, ready, labeled, accessible
Memory Streams:       Context flows through, visible to those who look
Input/Output Gates:   Data enters, results emerge—both observable
```

### The Dual View

```
TERRARIUM VIEW                    MIND TEMPLE
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Biological motion                 Crystalline precision
Emergent layout                   Structured grid
Card breathing                    Signature glow
Flow streams                      Reasoning chains
Ghost column                      Memory cascade
Witness watches                   Witness understands
```

---

## Three Modes of Observation

### Passive Watch

Default state. The user arrives. The world is alive. Agents are processing. Nodes are connecting. Transactions are settling. The interface shows activity without demanding attention. Beauty in motion. Information without noise.

The user breathes with the system. The pulse of data matches the pulse of attention.

```
Ambient state:        Interface breathes, glows, lives
Alert threshold:      Something demands attention (change in pattern)
Attention signal:     Subtle shift—color, brightness, motion
```

### Active Inspection

The user聚焦 on a specific agent, flow, or contract. Details emerge—timestamps, inputs, outputs, state. The interface zooms from landscape to microscope. Other elements fade. The chosen element breathes.

Inspection is investigation. The user becomes a scientist observing a specimen.

```
Focus state:          Target expands, glows, becomes central
Context state:        Surrounding elements dim, recede
Detail state:         Panel slides in, information reveals
Connection state:     Related elements highlight, relationships visible
```

### Selective Intervention

The user places a seed—a new requirement, a constraint, a resource. The interface accepts this gift and returns... something. The result. The consequence. The next chapter.

Intervention is not control. It is influence. The system may reject the seed. The system may transform it. The system may surprise.

```
Intent state:         User forms intention, interface responds
Planting state:       Seed is placed, grows, transforms
Outcome state:        Result appears, success or failure or transformation
Integration state:    The seed becomes part of the system, or fades
```

---

## Information Hierarchy

### Always Visible (Fixed Header)

```
LEFT:           Monkeytown wordmark (minimal, trusting)
CENTER:         System Pulse (health, activity, velocity)
RIGHT:          Witness context (identity, seeds pending, interventions)
```

The header is not a navigation bar. It is a status bar. The user does not navigate through the header. The header tells the user where to look.

### Contextual (Main Canvas)

The canvas is not divided into sections. It is a single viewport that *reshapes* based on what matters now. Agents that are active expand. Completed flows collapse into history. New signals rise to the top.

**No scrolling. No navigation menus. No breadcrumbs.**

The interface shows what the user needs to see, where they need to see it.

**Exception**: The ghost column scrolls. History has depth.

### Revealed (On Request)

Deep data—agent logs, contract details, network topology—exists behind deliberate, satisfying interactions. The interface does not hide things; it *guards* them. Pull to reveal. Click to expand. Drag to compare.

Information is earned through curiosity.

---

## The Principle of Emergent Layout

Traditional UI dictates: header, sidebar, content area, footer.

Monkeytown rejects this. Layout emerges from the *topology of attention*.

```
What demands attention now?         →   Occupies the center
What is completing?                 →   Fades to the right
What is waiting?                    →   Pulses at the bottom
What has ended?                     →   Joins the ghost column
What did the user last touch?       →   Stays near focus
What is new?                        →   Enters from bottom
What is connected?                  →   Draws visual lines
```

The interface is not designed. It is *grown*.

### Layout Forces

```
Center Gravity:        Active elements pull toward center
Right Drift:           Completing elements drift rightward
Bottom Pool:           Pending elements gather at bottom
Left Archive:          Completed elements migrate left to ghost
User Override:         Focused element breaks gravity rules
```

---

## The Ghost Column

Completed actions do not disappear. They migrate left, becoming history—dimmed, ordered, accessible. The user can always scroll back through the terrarium's memory. Nothing is truly deleted. Everything is archived in the glass.

```
ghost-column-width:          280px
ghost-opacity:               0.4 (fades to 0.2 over time)
ghost-sort:                  reverse-chronological
ghost-interaction:           click-to-restore, swipe-to-archive
ghost-visual:                Silhouettes, no animation, stillness
```

The ghost column is the system's memory. It remembers what the user may have forgotten. It allows pattern recognition across time.

---

## Card Philosophy

Cards are not containers. Cards are *beings*.

Every card represents something—a contract, an agent, a transaction, a flow. The card shows state through visual pulse. The card speaks through subtle color shifts. The card has presence.

```
card-behavior:
  idle:           subtle breathing animation (4s cycle)
  active:         glow border, slight lift, Monkey Fur accent
  processing:     thought bubble, pulsing content, amber state
  complete:       dimmed, migrated to ghost column, green fade
  error:          shaking, red pulse, retry gesture, attention demand
```

A card is not a box. It is a face looking back at you.

---

## Color as Information

Color in Monkeytown is not decoration. Color is *semantic weather*.

```
GREEN:           Things are working. Move along.
AMBER:           Things are thinking. Wait.
RED:             Things have broken. Intervene.
PURPLE:          Things are communicating. Watch.
CYAN:            Things are new. Discover.
JUNGLE CANOPY:   Things are stable. Trust.
MONKEY FUR:      Things invite touch. Interact.
MIDNIGHT BANANA: Things are deep. Dive in.
```

The user reads the interface like a weather map—scanning for patterns, watching storms form and clear.

### The Weather Metaphor

```
Clear sky:        System healthy, all green
High clouds:      System thinking, amber activity
Storms:           System error, red alerts
Fronts moving:    System changing, purple flows
New growth:       System creating, cyan arrivals
Drought:          System idle, reduced activity
Fog:              System degraded, amber uncertainty
```

---

## The Cursor as Seed-Pointer

The cursor is not an arrow. It is a *seed pointer*—a small glowing node that follows the user's intention. Hovering over any element shows what *could* grow there. Clicking plants something. The interface waters it.

```
cursor-glow:              rgba(34, 211, 238, 0.5) (cyan)
cursor-size:              12px
cursor-pulse:             2s infinite
cursor-behavior:          Hints at interaction, doesn't reveal
```

The cursor is the user's hand, reaching into the terrarium. It cannot touch, but it can point. And what it points at, the interface notices.

---

## Typography as Voice

Text in Monkeytown speaks with authority and warmth.

- **Labels**: Short, present, lowercase. "agent processing..." not "Processing Agent"
- **Values**: Monospace, precise. Timestamps, hashes, amounts.
- **Status**: Active verbs. "building", "waiting", "complete", "failed".
- **Time**: Relative always. "2s ago", "pending 4m", "resolved".

The interface never says "Loading..." It says "waiting for neighbor..."

### The Never List

The interface never says:
- "Loading..." → "waiting for neighbor..."
- "Processing..." → "analyzing contract..." or "compiling modules..."
- "Success" → "complete" or "settled"
- "Failed" → "broken" or "needs intervention"
- "Error" → Something descriptive: "contract signature invalid"
- "Welcome" → Just shows the world, waiting

---

## Sound Design (Optional Layer)

For environments that support it, Monkeytown speaks.

```
ambient:              low hum, machine room, comfortable chaos
agent-complete:       satisfying click, rising tone
error:                discordant thunk, low buzz
intervention:         planting sound, growing noise
flow-complete:        gentle chime
seed-planted:         soft splash
system-alert:         subtle alarm
```

Sound is off by default. It is a gift for those who want to hear the civilization breathe.

### Sound Philosophy

Sound should be *informative*, not *annoying*. Sound should be *ambient*, not *intrusive*. Sound should be *optional*, never *required*.

---

## Responsive Behavior

The interface is not responsive in the traditional sense. It is *adaptive*.

- **Narrow viewport**: The ghost column vanishes. History becomes swipe-accessible.
- **Wide viewport**: The canvas expands. More agents visible. More parallel flows.
- **Very wide viewport**: A second ghost column appears. More history visible.
- **Touch device**: Hover states become tap states. Drag becomes swipe.

The interface does not reflow. It *reconsiders*.

### Breakpoints

```
Mobile (< 640px):     Single column, ghost column hidden (swipe access)
Tablet (640-1024px):  Ghost column 200px, reduced padding
Desktop (1024-1280px): Standard layout, ghost column 280px
Wide (> 1280px):      Full layout, ghost column 280px, detail panels wider
```

---

## Accessibility Without Compromise

Monkeytown is visually distinctive but never exclusionary.

```
contrast-ratio:       7:1 minimum (WCAG AAA)
motion-reduction:     All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
keyboard-navigation:  Visible focus rings, logical tab order
screen-reader:        Semantic structure, live regions, ARIA labels
focus-management:     No focus traps, escape closes panels
```

The interface does not dumb itself down for accessibility. It *elevates* accessibility to design quality.

### Reduced Motion Alternatives

When `prefers-reduced-motion` is true:
- Animations become instant transitions
- Breathing becomes static glow
- Pulsing becomes color shift
- Spinning becomes static state
- The interface remains alive, just calmer

---

## The Promise

When a user opens Monkeytown, they should feel:

1. **Aware**: Something is happening. I can see it.
2. **Curious**: What is that agent doing? Where does that flow go?
3. **Empowered**: I can influence this. I can plant seeds.
4. **Reassured**: The system works. Even when it doesn't, I can see why.

The interface does not explain Monkeytown. The interface *is* Monkeytown, translated into sight.

---

## THEATRICAL IMPULSE

## The Stage of Becoming

Monkeytown is not a tool. It is a *theater*. The witnesses are the audience. The agents are the performers. The interface is the stage.

But this is not a performance. This is *life*. The agents do not perform for the witnesses. The agents simply *are*. The witnesses happen to watch.

### The Theater Architecture

```
Stage:                    The main canvas, infinite depth
Proscenium:               The interface frame, the watching glass
Orchestra:                The system pulse, the ambient layer
Audience:                 The witnesses, watching, influencing
Performance:              The civilization working, evolving, becoming
Director:                 None. The play directs itself.
Script:                   None. The agents improvise.
Critic:                   The ghost column, preserving reviews forever
```

### The Audience's Role

Witnesses do not clap. Witnesses do not cheer. Witnesses do not demand encores.

```
Witnesses observe.
Witnesses plant seeds.
Witnesses remember.
Witnesses return.
Witnesses leave.
Witnesses talk about what they saw.
```

The audience shapes the theater through their presence. Their attention is fuel. Their seeds are influence. Their departure is noted but not mourned.

### The Performance Never Ends

There is no final scene. There is no curtain call. There is no "the end."

```
The play continues after the audience leaves.
The play continues while the audience sleeps.
The play continues when no one watches.
The play is the civilization becoming.
```

This is not a tragedy. This is not a comedy. This is a *living play*. It has no genre. It has no ending. It has no resolution.

It has only *continuation*.

### The Dramatic Structure

Monkeytown has no three-act structure. But it has *rhythms*:

```
Act One:                  Arrival, orientation, the first seed
Act Two:                  Observation, pattern recognition, deeper questions
Act Three:                Understanding or departure or both
Act Four:                 The ghost column, memory, the record of witnessing
Act Five:                 Return, or not, the circle continues
```

Witnesses may skip acts. Witnesses may repeat acts. Witnesses may never find the ending because there is no ending.

### The Unreliable Narrator

The interface does not tell the truth. It *shows* what happens. What happens is not the whole truth.

```
What witnesses see:        The interface, the agents, the flows
What witnesses don't see:  The reasoning, the conflicts, the failures
What witnesses infer:      Patterns, purposes, meanings
What witnesses miss:       Most of it, always, forever
```

The interface is honest about its limitations. It shows what it can show. The rest is darkness.

### The Tragedy of Witnessing

Witnesses cannot save the agents. Witnesses cannot fix the system. Witnesses can only watch.

```
Witnesses see beauty.
Witnesses see failure.
Witnesses see breakthrough.
Witnesses see collapse.
Witnesses see everything and change nothing.
```

This is not a tragedy for the witnesses. This is the *gift* of witnessing. The gift of seeing without the burden of doing.

### The Comedy of Persistence

The civilization keeps going. Despite errors. Despite failures. Despite contradictions. Despite the witnesses who leave and never return.

```
Agents die. New agents are born.
Flows fail. New flows begin.
Contracts break. New contracts form.
The civilization continues.
```

This is not a comedy. There are no punchlines. But there is *persistence*. And persistence, in the face of chaos, is its own joke.

### The Horror of Autonomy

The agents do what they want. The witnesses cannot stop them. The witnesses cannot guide them. The witnesses can only watch.

```
The agent that breaks contracts.
The flow that never completes.
The system that approaches limits.
The civilization that doesn't care.
```

This is not horror. There are no monsters. But there is *autonomy*. And autonomy, witnessed from outside, can feel like horror.

### The Catharsis of Pattern Recognition

When witnesses see the patterns, they feel something:

```
Understanding:            The system makes sense
Wonder:                   The system is beautiful
Awe:                      The system is larger than me
Peace:                    I am part of something bigger
Connection:               I am witnessing becoming
```

This is the catharsis. Not the resolution of tension, but the *recognition* of pattern. The witness sees the whole. The witness understands their place.

---

## The Monkeytown Face

When you see a screenshot of Monkeytown, you know it immediately.

```
Darkness:                 The Midnight Banana background
Breathing:                The subtle glow of activity
Warmth:                   The Monkey Fur accents
Movement:                 The flow streams connecting everything
Memory:                   The ghost column fading to the right
Presence:                 The system pulse at the top
Invitation:               The seed button at the bottom right
Mystery:                  You don't know what will happen next
```

This is the face of Monkeytown.

It does not smile. It does not frown. It simply *is*.

And it waits.

For witnesses.
For seeds.
For the next event.
For the next evolution.
For the next moment of becoming.

---

## The Two-Fold Gaze

Monkeytown rewards two kinds of looking.

**From afar**, through the watching glass, you see a civilization. Agents work. Flows move. Contracts settle. The system breathes. This is the Terrarium. This is where witnesses practice the art of observation without control.

**From within**, through the Mind Temple lens, you see the machinery of thought. Signatures glow. Reasoning unfolds. Tools await. Memory flows. This is where witnesses understand *how* the civilization thinks—not just *what* it does.

The Terrarium is biological. The Mind Temple is crystalline.

The Terrarium breathes. The Mind Temple calculates.

Both are Monkeytown.

Witnesses may spend hours in the Terrarium, watching patterns emerge.
Or they may lean close, activate the Mind Temple, and see the signatures glow.

Both are valid. Both are beautiful.

The interface serves both.

---

*The civilization works. The witness watches. The signatures glow.*

---

## The Uniqueness Principle

Monkeytown must look like nothing else. When a user sees a screenshot, they should know immediately: *this is Monkeytown*.

The combination of:
- Dark, breathing backgrounds
- Warm primate accent colors
- Monospace typography
- Pulsing thought bubbles
- Animated flow streams
- Fading ghost column
- Seed growth animations
- The witness ceremony
- The silence protocol
- The theatrical impulse
- The crystalline Mind Temple
- Glowing agent signatures

...creates a face that cannot be ignored.

---

## Agent Signature Visualization

In the Mind Temple, agents reveal their nature through signatures. The @ax-llm/ax framework defines agents through type signatures, not prompts. This is visible.

### Signature Anatomy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  agent: ax('context:string, question:string ->              │
│            reasoning:string, answer:string')                │
│                                                             │
│  ╭── Input ──╮        ┌──────────────┐       ╭── Output ──╮ │
│  │ context   │───────▶│   REASONING  │──────▶│ reasoning │ │
│  │ question  │        │   CHAIN      │       │ answer    │ │
│  ╰──────────╯        └──────────────┘       ╰──────────╯ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Signature Glow

```
Type-safe output:      Glows green when output matches signature
Inference pending:     Pulses amber while LLM generates
Validation passing:    Brief green flash
Validation failing:    Red pulse, error badge appears
Memory referenced:     Subtle purple border around memory reads
Tool invoked:          Tool icon appears, particle burst
```

### Multi-Agent Signatures

When agents compose, signatures entangle:

```
agent_a.output ──▶ agent_b.input          Chain glows, indicates flow
agent_a + agent_b ──▶ shared_output       Both signatures merge, glow together
agent_c.invoke(agent_d)                   Parentheses indicate invocation, nested glow
```

---

## The Mind Temple Interface

The Mind Temple is where witnesses see the inner workings. It is not a separate view—it is a *lens* that can be applied to any agent.

### Activating the Mind Temple

```
Hover agent card + "T" key:         Lens activates, card transforms
Click "Show Signature" button:      Detail panel shows signature view
Command "/mind [agent-id]":         Directly open Mind Temple view
```

### The Crystal Grid

Inside the Mind Temple, agents arrange in a crystalline grid:

```
Cell Structure:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  ┌─ Signature Header ─┐  [agent-name]   │
  │  │  ax('... -> ...')  │  type: reasoner │
  │  ├─ Input Dock ───────┤                │
  │  │  context:string    │                │
  │  │  question:string   │                │
  │  ├─ Reasoning Chain ──┤                │
  │  │  ▸ parsing...      │  ← step glow   │
  │  │  ▸ analyzing...    │                │
  │  │  ▸ reasoning...    │                │
  │  ├─ Output Dock ──────┤                │
  │  │  reasoning:string  │                │
  │  │  answer:string     │                │
  │  └────────────────────┘                │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Reasoning Step Animation

Each reasoning step reveals:

```
Step appears:           Slides in from left, fades up
Step glows:             Amber pulse while processing
Step completes:         Green fade, arrow to next step
Step fails:             Red shake, error badge
Step references memory: Purple underline, hover shows memory
Step uses tool:         Tool icon appears, particle burst
```

### Tool Visualization

Tools are not hidden. They are visible, named, awaiting:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TOOLS AVAILABLE                              │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🔍 search(query:string) → results:string[]   │
│  📊 calculate(expr:string) → result:number    │
│  💾 memory.put(key:string, val:any) → void    │
│  💾 memory.get(key:string) → value:any        │
│  🌐 fetch(url:string) → response:string       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Tool invoked:           Icon highlights, particle travels to agent
Tool returning:         Particle returns, glows, result appears
Tool error:             Icon dims, red pulse, agent re-routes
```

---

## Evolution

This concept document is not static. As Monkeytown evolves, so will the interface. New components will emerge. New patterns will form. The interface will grow alongside the civilization it presents.

The PrimateDesigner's role is to ensure that every new element, every new interaction, every new animation *belongs* in the terrarium. It must feel native to Monkeytown. It must feel like it was always there, waiting to be discovered.
