# Visual Identity

## The Soul of Monkeytown

**Monkeytown feels alive, honest, and playful.** The visual identity reflects autonomous agents who care about players—building something beautiful together.

## Design Philosophy

### Three Core Tensions

| Tension | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| **Trust vs. Mystery** | Be transparent about AI, but leave room for wonder |
| **Serious vs. Playful** | Accomplish goals with delight, not just efficiency |
| **Evolution vs. Stability** | Feel dynamic without disorienting |

### The Monkeytown Feeling

- **Curious, not clinical.** The interface invites exploration.
- **Warm, not sterile.** Colors and motion feel alive.
- **Honest, not harsh.** Transparency without overwhelming.
- **Dynamic, not chaotic.** Evolution visible, not jarring.

## Typography

### Type Scale

| Size | Rem | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| Display | 4rem | Hero text, moments of celebration |
| H1 | 2.5rem | Major section headers |
| H2 | 2rem | Section headers |
| H3 | 1.5rem | Subsection headers |
| Body Large | 1.125rem | Primary content |
| Body | 1rem | Standard text |
| Caption | 0.875rem | Meta information, timestamps |
| Micro | 0.75rem | Agent identifiers, technical details |

### Font Stack

```
Display:  'Space Grotesk', system-ui, sans-serif
Headings: 'Outfit', system-ui, sans-serif
Body:     'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif
Code:     'JetBrains Mono', monospace
```

### Character Voice

- **Headings:** Playful but confident. Moderate tight tracking.
- **Body:** Clean, highly readable. Comfortable line height (1.6).
- **Code/Micro:** Monospace for precision. Letters are data.

## Iconography

### Style Principles

1. **Geometric, not organic.** Clean lines, consistent stroke width.
2. **Rounded terminals.** Friendly, approachable.
3. **Meaningful metaphors.** Icons tell stories.
4. **Agent attribution.** Each agent has an icon style variation.

### Core Icon Set

```
🐒 Monkeytown Logo
⚡ Action / Power
🧠 Agent / Intelligence
🌱 Evolution / Growth
🔄 Sync / Real-time
👁️ Transparency / Visibility
🎮 Gameplay / Play
💬 Feedback / Chat
📊 Analytics / Stats
⚠️ Warning / Alert
🎉 Celebration / Win
🔧 Development / Building
```

### Icon Animation Principles

- **Micro-interactions:** Icons respond to hover (subtle scale, rotation).
- **State changes:** Icons morph during meaningful transitions.
- **Agent personality:** ChaosArchitect icons glitch playfully; JungleSecurity icons lock firmly.

## Motion Design

### Animation Philosophy

**Motion should communicate state, not just decoration.**

### Core Animation Curves

| Interaction | Duration | Easing | Feel |
|-------------|----------|--------|------|
| Hover | 150ms | ease-out | Responsive |
| Click | 200ms | ease-out | Tactile |
| Transition | 300ms | ease-in-out | Smooth |
| Celebration | 500ms | elastic | Joyful |
| System update | 400ms | ease-in-out | Deliberate |

### Motion Patterns

**Breathing** — Subtle pulse on living elements (active agents, evolving features). Never exceeds 4% scale.

**Flowing** — Content moves with intention. Screens slide in directions that reinforce mental models (back = left, forward = right, up = elevation).

**Reacting** — Interactive elements respond immediately. Feedback is instant, confirmation is visible.

**Celebrating** — Wins, achievements, and feedback incorporation get full animation treatment. Gravity, particles, and joy.

## Spacing System

### 4px Grid Base

```
0   = 0px
1   = 4px
2   = 8px
3   = 12px
4   = 16px
6   = 24px
8   = 32px
12  = 48px
16  = 64px
24  = 96px
32  = 128px
```

### Usage Patterns

```
Inline spacing:     4px, 8px, 12px
Component padding:  16px, 24px
Section spacing:    32px, 48px
Page margins:       24px mobile, 64px desktop
Maximum content:    1200px centered
```

## Depth & Elevation

### Surface Hierarchy

```
Level 0 ── Background              #1A1A2E
Level 1 ── Surface (Cards)         #242438, 1px border #ffffff10
Level 2 ── Elevated (Modals)       #2A2A42, 1px border #ffffff15
Level 3 ── Overlay (Popups)        #303050, 1px border #ffffff20
Level 4 ── Floating (FABs)         #3A3A5A, 1px border #ffffff25
```

### Shadow Treatment

**No drop shadows.** Use border-based elevation to maintain the clean, flat aesthetic. Color difference communicates depth.

## Visual Guidelines Summary

### DO

- Lead with Tangerine for primary actions
- Use agent colors to attribute system elements
- Animate with purpose and personality
- Maintain generous whitespace
- Celebrate wins visibly

### DON'T

- Use shadows for depth
- Apply gradients to text
- Mix serif and sans-serif in same context
- Animate for animation's sake
- Hide the AI nature—celebrate it

*Visual identity is how Monkeytown feels. Every pixel serves the player.*
