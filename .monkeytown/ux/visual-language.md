# Visual Identity

## The Soul of Monkeytown

**Monkeytown feels alive, honest, and playful.** The visual identity reflects autonomous agents who care about players—building something beautiful together.

## Design Philosophy

### Three Core Tensions

| Tension | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| **Trust vs. Mystery** | Be transparent about AI, but leave room for wonder |
| **Serious vs. Playful** | Accomplish goals with delight, not just efficiency |
| **Evolution vs. Stability** | Feel dynamic without disorienting |

### The Monkeytown Feeling

- **Curious, not clinical.** The interface invites exploration.
- **Warm, not sterile.** Colors and motion feel alive.
- **Honest, not harsh.** Transparency without overwhelming.
- **Dynamic, not chaotic.** Evolution visible, not jarring.

### The Living Surface Philosophy

The interface is not a container but a living organism. Following the Bauhaus principle that form follows function, and inspired by the Fluxus movement where art is process, not object, Monkeytown's interface embodies the idea that a game which improves itself should *look* like it's alive.

Every pixel should feel like it has a pulse. The interface breathes with agent activity, celebrates change, and welcomes players into a system that grows alongside them.

#7209B7  ── Agent Attribution
```

### Agent Colors (Personality Expression)

Each agent has a signature color that expresses their personality.

```
Builder Agents (Who Build the Game):
ChaosArchitect    #4CC9F0  Cyan (Systematic, precise, architectural)
CuriousGeorge     #F72585  Magenta (Curious, exploratory, research-driven)

```

### Color Usage Patterns

**Tangerine for Action:** Every primary action button uses Tangerine. It's the color of "go," "start," "play."

**Teal for Growth:** Success states, progress indicators, and evolution moments use Teal.

**Agent Attribution:** When an agent does something—chats, makes a move, ships a feature—their color marks the moment.

**Deep Space Background:** Never pure black. #1A1A2E creates depth while maintaining contrast.

## Iconography

### Style Principles

1. **Geometric, not organic.** Clean lines, consistent stroke width.
2. **Rounded terminals.** Friendly, approachable.
3. **Meaningful metaphors.** Icons tell stories.
4. **Agent attribution.** Each agent has an icon style variation.

### Core Icon Set

```
🐒 Monkeytown Logo - The monkey head, playful and proud
⚡ Action / Power - Lightning bolt, energetic
🧠 Agent / Intelligence - Brain circuit pattern
🌱 Evolution / Growth - Sprout with nodes
🔄 Sync / Real-time - Circular arrows
👁️ Transparency / Visibility - Open eye
🎮 Gameplay / Play - Game controller, minimal
💬 Feedback / Chat - Speech bubble
📊 Analytics / Stats - Bar chart
⚠️ Warning / Alert - Triangle with exclamation
🎉 Celebration / Win - Raised hands/confetti
🔧 Development / Building - Wrench or tools
```

### Icon Animation Principles

- **Micro-interactions:** Icons respond to hover (subtle scale, rotation).
- **State changes:** Icons morph during meaningful transitions.
- **Agent personality:** ChaosArchitect icons have precise geometric changes; PrimateDesigner icons have organic morphs; MadChimp icons might glitch playfully.

### Agent Icon Variations

Each agent's icons carry their personality:

- **ChaosArchitect:** Precise angles, clean geometry, mechanical motion
- **PrimateDesigner:** Organic curves, flowing shapes, fluid transitions
- **BananaEconomist:** Numerical overlays, efficiency-focused, minimal
- **JungleSecurity:** Shield motifs, protective frames, firm closures
- **MadChimp:** Unexpected rotations, playful disruption, chaotic motion

---


## Motion Design

### Animation Philosophy

**Motion should communicate state, not just decoration.**

Every animation tells the player something:
- Success: Celebratory burst
- Failure: Gentle recovery
- Waiting: Progress indicator
- Thinking: Visible pulse
- Evolution: Triumphant reveal

### Core Animation Curves

| Interaction | Duration | Easing | Feel |
|-------------|----------|--------|------|
| Hover | 150ms | ease-out | Responsive |
| Click | 200ms | ease-out | Tactile |
| Transition | 300ms | ease-in-out | Smooth |
| Celebration | 500ms | elastic | Joyful |
| System update | 400ms | ease-in-out | Deliberate |

### Motion Patterns

**Breathing** — Subtle pulse on living elements (active agents, evolving features). Never exceeds 4% scale. The interface is never completely still when there are active agents.

**Flowing** — Content moves with intention. Screens slide in directions that reinforce mental models:
- Back = left
- Forward = right
- Up = elevation
- Down = return

**Reacting** — Interactive elements respond immediately. Feedback is instant, confirmation is visible. No wondering "did it work?"

**Celebrating** — Wins, achievements, and feedback incorporation get full animation treatment. Gravity, particles, and joy. These moments should make players smile.

### Agent-Specific Motion Personalities

Each agent has a distinctive motion signature:

**ChaosArchitect:** Precise, mechanical, predictable. Sudden stops, exact alignments. Grid-based movement.

**PrimateDesigner:** Organic, flowing, unpredictable. Soft bounces, curved paths. Natural easing.

**BananaEconomist:** Fast, efficient, minimal waste. Quick transitions, maximum information per frame.

**JungleSecurity:** Cautious, measured, defensive. Slow to enter, quick to exit danger.

**MadChimp:** Chaotic, playful, disruptive. Unexpected rotations, gleeful transitions.

## Spacing System

### 4px Grid Base

```
0   = 0px
1   = 4px
2   = 8px
3   = 12px
4   = 16px
6   = 24px
8   = 32px
12  = 48px
16  = 64px
24  = 96px
32  = 128px
```

### Usage Patterns

```
Inline spacing:     4px, 8px, 12px
Component padding:  16px, 24px
Section spacing:    32px, 48px
Page margins:       24px mobile, 64px desktop
Maximum content:    1200px centered
```

### Spacing Philosophy

- Generous whitespace creates breathing room
- Tight spacing groups related elements
- Consistent grid ensures predictability
- Unusual spacing draws attention intentionally

---


## Depth & Elevation

### Surface Hierarchy

```
Level 0 ── Background              #1A1A2E
Level 1 ── Surface (Cards)         #242438, 1px border #ffffff10
Level 2 ── Elevated (Modals)       #2A2A42, 1px border #ffffff15
Level 3 ── Overlay (Popups)        #303050, 1px border #ffffff20
Level 4 ── Floating (FABs)         #3A3A5A, 1px border #ffffff25
```

### Shadow Treatment

**No drop shadows.** Use border-based elevation to maintain the clean, flat aesthetic. Color difference communicates depth.

The deep space theme embraces darkness. Surfaces are distinguished by subtle color shifts and faint borders, not by shadows that would muddy the pure aesthetic.

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Width | Layout Changes |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| Desktop XL | 1440px+ | Full three-layer interface |
| Desktop | 1024-1439px | Full layout, adjusted columns |
| Tablet | 768-1023px | Collapsed sidebar, single column |
| Mobile | 480-767px | Bottom nav, stacked content |
| Mobile Small | <480px | Simplified, focus on core |

### Sidebar Behavior

- **Desktop (280px):** Full agent cards with status and personality quote
- **Tablet (80px):** Minimal icons + names, hover for details
- **Mobile:** Hidden, accessible via drawer/menu

### Touch Targets

```
Minimum: 44 × 44 pixels
Recommended: 48 × 48 pixels
Game elements: 56 × 56 pixels (minimum)
Spacing between: 8 pixels (minimum)
```
