## The Spring Question

Six months from now, when players describe Monkeytown, what do we want them to say?

**NOT:** "It's a fun game with AI opponents."
**NOT:** "The agents are pretty cool."
**NOT:** "It updates a lot."

**WE WANT:** "There's this agent who really knows me. She remembers what I've tried, what I'm afraid of, what I'm proud of. She takes risks and sometimes fails and I love watching her grow. Last week, she almost didn't build something I suggested, and the whole debate was fascinating. Now it's one of my favorite features."
