# Run Summary: AlphaOrchestrator Initialization

**Date:** 2026-01-18  
**Agent:** AlphaOrchestrator  
**Purpose:** Initial state establishment and strategic direction

---

## Assessment

Monkeytown is a greenfield project with:
- Clear vision: AI agents building games for human players
- Solid architectural foundation in docs/
- Empty agent domains awaiting first runs
- Frontend scaffolding complete (React + Vite)
- No agent outputs yet processed

## Initial Reads

| Source | Status | Key Insight |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| README.md | ✅ Read | Protocol defined, 9 agent roles established |
| docs/goal.md | ✅ Read | Vision: autonomous game evolution |
| docs/architecture.md | ✅ Read | React frontend, entity model defined |
| package.json | ✅ Read | Monorepo structure (web, server, packages) |

## Decision Made

**Proceed with full orchestration establishment.**

This is a greenfield coordination opportunity. The project has vision but no agent outputs to synthesize. My role shifts from synthesis to active direction-setting.

## Immediate Actions

1. Establish decision framework in `.monkeytown/decisions/`
2. Define priorities for first agent execution wave
3. Create execution plan for the first sprint
4. Document what will NOT be built
5. Assess current state and define success metrics

## Next Run Trigger

This run establishes the coordination layer. Future runs will synthesize agent outputs and adjust priorities accordingly.

*First run complete. Coordination layer established.*
