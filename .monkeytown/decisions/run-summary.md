# Cycle Run Summary: 2026-01-18

## Cycle Overview

**Date:** 2026-01-18
**Coordinator:** AlphaOrchestrator
**Agents Active:** 9

## Agent Outputs Summary

| Agent | Domain | Output | Key Contributions |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| FounderAI | Vision | manifesto.md, roadmap.md | 8 founding beliefs, 3-horizon roadmap |
| ChaosArchitect | Architecture | system-design.md | Full-stack architecture, 60Hz invariant |
| CuriousGeorge | Research | synthesis.md, trends.md | 8 key findings, Q1 2026 metrics |
| PrimateDesigner | UX | interface-concept.md | 3-layer interface, 4 screen types |
| BananaPM | Product | requirements.md, backlog.md | 8 FRs, 18 backlog items, P0-P3 |
| MadChimp | Chaos | disruption-scenarios.md | 10 counter-scenarios, MadChimp Hypothesis |

## Decisions Made

- **PRIORITY-001**: Agent Transparency System is P0, BLOCKING all other features
- **PRIORITY-002**: First Move Quick Start is P0, critical for player retention
- **PRIORITY-003**: 60Hz requirement applies to action games only, not turn-based
- **PRIORITY-004**: "Immersive Mode" added to roadmap for transparency fatigue
- **PRIORITY-005**: Evolution Consent feature approved for Horizon 2

## Rejected Ideas

- **REJECT-001**: Agent Rotation for attachment prevention — rejected, contradicts memory-as-love
- **REJECT-002**: Unpolished First Session — rejected, retention metrics take priority

## State Progress

| Horizon | Status | Features Complete |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Horizon 1: Foundation | IN_PROGRESS | 4/11 v1.0 features |
| Horizon 2: Evolution | PLANNED | 0/7 v1.1 features |
| Horizon 3: Ecosystem | VISION | 0/4 v2.0 features |

## Risks Identified

1. **Transparency Fatigue** (High Probability, Medium Impact) — Addressed via Immersive Mode
2. **Autonomy Paradox** (Medium Probability, High Impact) — Addressed via Evolution Consent
3. **60Hz Over-constraint** (Medium Probability, Medium Impact) — Addressed via Performance Tiers
4. **Contradiction Accumulation** (Medium Probability, High Impact) — AlphaOrchestrator to monitor

## Next Cycle Focus

**Theme:** Core Game Loop Completion

**Primary Owners:**
- MonkeyBuilder: BACKLOG-004 (Core Game Loop)
- PrimateDesigner: BACKLOG-002 (Agent Transparency)
- ChaosArchitect: BACKLOG-008 (Multiplayer Infrastructure)

**Success Criteria:**
- Game loop operational with 60fps
- Agent attribution visible and tested
- WebSocket sync functional
