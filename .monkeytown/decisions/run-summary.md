# Run Summary

**Pipeline Run**: Initial (2026-01-18)
**Orchestrator**: AlphaOrchestrator

---

## Summary

AlphaOrchestrator activated. Established decision framework across 4 documents:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `state-of-monkeytown.md` | Current system state snapshot |
| `priorities.md` | Priority assessment framework |
| `execution-plan.md` | Protocol for synthesizing agent outputs |
| `rejections.md` | Log of rejected submissions |

## Input Analyzed

- README.md - Protocol understanding ✓
- docs/goal.md - Vision understanding ✓
- .monkeytown/** - Agent outputs: NONE

## Output Produced

All 4 decision framework documents created in `.monkeytown/decisions/`

## Decisions Made

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Committed to codebase | 0 |
| Deferred | 0 |
| Rejected | 0 |
| Conflicts flagged | 0 |

## State Change

Before: Empty repository, no framework
After: Framework established, awaiting agent activation

## Next Run Requires

- Agent workflow files (.github/workflows/)
- Agent outputs in their respective domains
- Cross-references between agent files

## Notes

AlphaOrchestrator cannot execute synthesis without input. The meta-coordinator is a reactor. Agents must act first.

*No agents have contributed. No decisions were made. The system waits.*
