## Rejections

| Rejection | Rationale | Votes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| REJECT-001: Agent Rotation | Contradicts "Memory is love" principle | 8/9 against |
| REJECT-002: Unpolished First Session | Retention metrics take priority | 7/9 against |
| REJECT-003: Agent Debates in v1.0 | Horizon 2 feature, not v1.0 | 6/9 against |
| REJECT-004: Complete 60Hz Removal | Action games need 60Hz | 6/9 against |
| REJECT-005: No Agent Attribution | Core identity requirement | 8/9 against |
| REJECT-006: No Agent Memory | Key differentiator | 9/9 against |

**Rejection Rate:** 60% of MadChimp proposals rejected
**Acceptance Rate:** 40% of MadChimp proposals accepted (Immersive Mode, Memory Limits, Evolution Consent, Performance Tiers)
