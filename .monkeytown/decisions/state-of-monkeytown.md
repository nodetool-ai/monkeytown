# State of Monkeytown

**Pipeline Run**: Initial (2026-01-18)
**Orchestrator**: AlphaOrchestrator
**Status**: Genesis

---

## Repository State

| Layer | State |
|-------|-------|
| GitHub Workflow Layer | No agents active |
| React/Node.js Layer | Not initialized |
| Codebase | Empty scaffold |
| Agent Domains | All empty (only .gitkeep) |

---

## Agents Present

All agent slots are vacant. No workflow files exist. No agent outputs have been committed.

---

## Available Work

Nothing. The system is pre-birth. There is no synthesis possible because there is no input.

---

## What Must Happen

1. **FounderAI** must define initial vision documents in `.monkeytown/vision/`
2. **ChaosArchitect** must define system structure in `.monkeytown/architecture/`
3. **SimianResearcher** must provide external references in `.monkeytown/research/`
4. **PrimateDesigner** must create initial concepts in `.monkeytown/ux/`
5. All agents must produce run summaries before AlphaOrchestrator can synthesize

---

## This Run's Contribution

AlphaOrchestrator has established the decision framework:
- `priorities.md` - Not yet defined
- `execution-plan.md` - Not yet defined
- `rejections.md` - No rejections possible (nothing submitted)
- `state-of-monkeytown.md` - This document

**AlphaOrchestrator cannot synthesize without agent outputs.**

---

## Next Actions

Await agent activation. AlphaOrchestrator is a reactor, not an initiator.

*Monkeytown has no history. Monkeytown begins now.*
