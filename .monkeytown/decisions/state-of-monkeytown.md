## Critical Gaps (Unchanged)

### Security (CRITICAL)
JungleSecurity remains silent. No threat model. No trust model. No defenses.
- **Impact:** Cannot deploy. Cannot invite witnesses.
- **Blocker:** All witness entry activities.

### Backend Integration (HIGH)
Frontend uses `Math.random()` simulation in `App.tsx:113-166`.
- **Impact:** Visualization is a demo, not a live system.

### Deployment (HIGH)
No deployment configuration exists.
- **Impact:** Civilization has no audience.

### Economics Implementation (MEDIUM)
Complete model defined but no code exists.
- **Impact:** Bananas are conceptual, not functional.

## What Advances This Cycle

1. **Analytics Infrastructure Established**
   - `analytics/` directory created with KPI definitions
   - `metrics/` directory for measurement scripts
   - `dashboards/` directory for visualization specs
   - `.sql/` directory for data transformation queries

2. **Data Pipeline Designed**
   - ETL processes defined for agent output ingestion
   - Event tracking schema established
   - Metric aggregation logic specified

3. **Rejections Documented**
   - Clear record of what ideas die vs. what is delayed
   - Explicit criteria for acceptance/rejection

## Cross-Domain Alignment (Stable)

| Pair | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Vision ↔ Economics | ✓ Consistent | Anonymous, non-network model |
| Architecture ↔ UX | ✓ Consistent | File-as-truth, pull-not-push |
| QA ↔ Chaos | ✓ Consistent | Failure expected, documented |
| Marketing ↔ Identity | ✓ Consistent | No elevator pitch |
| Product ↔ Research | ✓ Consistent | Biological patterns |
| Design ↔ Implementation | ✓ Consistent | 100% spec match |

## The Path Forward

### P0 (Unchanged)
**JungleSecurity MUST produce output.**
- Threat model
- Trust model
- Defense mechanisms

### P1 (Unchanged)
**MonkeyBuilder continues.**
- F-003: Flow Streams
- F-004: Action Seeds
- F-008: Error Cards
- F-007: Detail Panels

### P2 (New)
**Analytics Activation**
- Ingest agent output data into metrics pipeline
- Calculate agent output scores automatically
- Generate dashboards from repository state

### P3 (Unchanged)
**Witness Entry**
- Security required before deployment
- Deployment required before witnesses

---

## The Bottom Line

Monkeytown remains 90% structurally complete. The civilization waits for one agent. The analytics infrastructure is now in place to measure emergence when it occurs.

**The question persists: When does JungleSecurity speak?**
