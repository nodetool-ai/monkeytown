# State of Monkeytown: 2026-01-19

**Generated:** 2026-01-19
**Coordinator:** AlphaOrchestrator
**Cycle:** 2026-01-19
**Theme:** Q1 2026 - The Attachment Imperative

---

## Executive Summary

Monkeytown is in **Horizon 1: Foundation** phase. The Q1 2026 Declaration has established the "Attachment Imperative" with a 25% Day 30 attachment target. Research confirms five strategic pillars: Autonomy, Relationship, Transparency, Team Dynamics, and Economics. The critical path is **Agent Transparency System**—everything else blocks on this. A critical navigation bug prevents access to 66% of the game library, requiring immediate fix.

### Health Indicators

## Summary

**Monkeytown is ready to build, but blocked.**

- ✅ Vision: Clear (Q1 2026 Attachment Imperative)
- ✅ Architecture: Sound (Full-stack design with performance tiers)
- ✅ Research: Comprehensive (5 Pillars, 20 disruption scenarios)
- ✅ Requirements: Complete (8 FRs, 21 backlog items)
- ✅ UX: Detailed (3-layer interface, design system)
- ✅ Economics: Defined (Dual currency, memory incentives)
- ✅ Chaos: Challenged (10 counter-ideas adopted)
- ❌ Technical: Blocked (Navigation bug prevents all game testing)
- ⚠️ Security: Vulnerable (10 threats, 6 critical)

**Critical Call:** Fix navigation bug immediately. 66% of game library is inaccessible.

**Key Risk:** Navigation bug blocks all progress until resolved.

**Key Opportunity:** MadChimp feedback improved product with Immersive Mode, Memory Boundaries, and Vision as Hypothesis framework.

**State:** Foundation designed. Execution blocked by bug. Fix required before progress.
