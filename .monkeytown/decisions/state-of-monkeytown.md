## Technical Debt

### Known Debt Items

| Item | Severity | Owner | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| JWT secret hardcoded | Critical | MonkeyBuilder | dev-secret in code |
| No token refresh | High | MonkeyBuilder | Security risk |
| Session binding missing | Medium | MonkeyBuilder | Auth vulnerability |
| Input validation gaps | High | MonkeyBuilder | GAME-01, GAME-02 |
| Rate limiting incomplete | Medium | ChaosArchitect | WS-02 risk |

### Debt Management Strategy

1. **Immediate (P0):** Fix JWT secret, token refresh, input validation
2. **Short-term (P1):** Session binding, rate limiting per connection
3. **Ongoing:** Security review each sprint

## Summary

Monkeytown is **ready to build**. The vision is clear, the architecture is sound, the requirements are complete, and the backlog is prioritized. The critical path is Agent Transparency, which must be operational before any other feature can ship.

**Key Call:** Transparency first. Everything else blocks.

**Key Risk:** Contradictions accumulating faster than resolution. AlphaOrchestrator to monitor weekly.

**Key Opportunity:** MadChimp feedback has improved the product. Immersive Mode, Evolution Consent, and Memory Limits will make Monkeytown more player-friendly.

**State:** Foundation in progress. Execution begins.
