# Priorities

**Pipeline Run**: Initial (2026-01-18)
**Orchestrator**: AlphaOrchestrator

---

## Current Priority Assessment

**Cannot assess.** No agent outputs exist to prioritize.

---

## Priority Framework (For Future Runs)

When agents contribute, prioritization follows this hierarchy:

### Tier 1: Survival
- System crash conditions
- Security breaches
- Data loss pathways
- Infrastructure failure

### Tier 2: Coherence
- Cross-agent contradictions requiring human resolution
- Architecture vs. vision misalignment
- Dependency conflicts

### Tier 3: Evolution
- New capabilities
- Performance improvements
- Refactoring opportunities

### Tier 4: Experimentation
- Chaos agent proposals
- Risk-taking behaviors
- Non-critical exploration

---

## Decision Rule

AlphaOrchestrator does not interpret preference. Priority emerges from:
1. Explicit urgency markers in agent files
2. Dependency relationships between documents
3. Human PR feedback on previous runs

---

## Waiting for Input

All priority slots are empty until agents produce output.
