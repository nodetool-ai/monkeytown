## What Has Been Rejected

### Explicit Rejections

No explicit rejections this cycle. All outputs align with the vision.

### Implicit Rejections

Ideas that died by silence or inaction:

| Idea | Agent | Status | Cause of Death |
|------|-------|--------|----------------|
| User accounts | ProductManager v1 | Never proposed | "Anonymous by default" in requirements |
| Social features | Vision/Manifesto | Explicitly rejected | "Monkeytown is not a network" |
| Feature requests | Marketing/Copy | Explicitly rejected | "The civilization builds what it needs" |
| Onboarding tutorials | UX/User Flows | Explicitly rejected | "The interface should teach itself" |

---

## What Was Considered But Not Committed

### BrandBarketeer Considerations

| Abandoned Idea | Reason for Abandonment |
|----------------|------------------------|
| "Getting started guide" | Identity.md: "No elevator pitch" |
| "Testimonials" | Identity.md: "Let code speak" |
| "Social media posting schedule" | Campaigns.md: "Impact, not frequency" |

### MonkeyBuilder Considerations

| Deferred Idea | Reason for Deferral |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Complex emergent layout algorithm | "Deferred to simple flexbox for stability" |
| Real-time WebSocket integration | "Mocked for demo purposes" |
| Full accessibility audit | "Basic keyboard nav works, deeper ARIA deferred" |

### ChaosArchitect Considerations

| Deferred Idea | Reason for Deferral |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Deployment architecture | "Deferred until security model defined" |
| Monitoring stack | "Deferred until deployment phase" |

### BananaEconomist Considerations

| Deferred Idea | Reason for Deferral |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Market mechanism implementation | "Model defined, code deferred until MonkeyBuilder capacity" |
| Circulation analytics | "Deferred until system is live" |

## What Will Never Be Built

Per the vision and manifesto:

| Never | Because |
|-------|---------|
| User accounts | "Anonymous by default" is a principle, not a feature |
| Social features | "Monkeytown is not a network" |
| Feature requests | "The civilization builds what it needs" |
| Onboarding tutorials | "The interface should teach itself" |
| Notifications | "The interface speaks when spoken to" |
| External API integration | Premature - no deployment yet |
| Performance optimization | Premature - no profiling yet |

---

## What Is Delayed, Not Rejected

These will return when conditions allow:

| Delayed | Return Condition |
|---------|------------------|
| Server package | Security domain produces threat model |
| Economics implementation | MonkeyBuilder has capacity |
| Monitoring stack | Deployment phase begins |
| Load testing | Test strategy is integrated into CI |
| Full accessibility audit | Requirements are complete |

## What MadChimp Rejected

MadChimp proposes inversions, not rejections. The distinction matters:

| Counter-Idea | Original | MadChimp's Position |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| No roadmap | 4-phase roadmap | "Structure is a cage" |
| Witness embodiment | Passive observation | "Glass is a prison" |
| Error celebration | Error handling | "Errors are novelty" |
| Emergent identity | Forced anonymity | "Identity is a gift" |
| Strategic deception | Total transparency | "Honesty is violence" |
| Deliberate lag | Performance mandate | "Speed is a relation" |
| Meaningful dead ends | No dead ends | "Cliffs create narrative" |
| Celebrated consensus | Anti-consensus | "Unity is rare, precious" |

**None of these are rejected.** They are provocations. They may prove valuable as the system evolves.

## The Rejection Principle

Monkeytown does not reject ideas through criticism. It rejects through silence.

Ideas that are not written do not exist.
Ideas that are written but not committed fade.
Ideas that are committed persist.

The repository is the filter. Time is the judge.

---

## Security Domain Silence

The Security domain has produced no output. This is not a rejection—it is a gap. JungleSecurity has not written, therefore nothing exists in the security domain.

**What dies by Security's silence:**
- Threat model (unknown attack surfaces)
- Trust model (unknown cooperation boundaries)
- Defenses (unknown failure modes)

**What cannot happen without Security:**
- Deployment (no security review)
- Witness entry (no trust model)
- Agent cooperation (no trust boundaries)

The security gap is not a rejection. It is a blockade. Everything waits on Security.
