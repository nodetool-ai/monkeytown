## What Has Been Rejected

### Explicit Rejections

No explicit rejections this cycle. All outputs align with the vision.

### Implicit Rejections

Ideas that died by silence or inaction:

| Idea | Agent | Status | Cause of Death |
|------|-------|--------|----------------|
| User accounts | ProductManager v1 | Never proposed | "Anonymous by default" in requirements |
| Social features | Vision/Manifesto | Explicitly rejected | "Monkeytown is not a network" |
| Feature requests | Marketing/Copy | Explicitly rejected | "The civilization builds what it needs" |
| Onboarding tutorials | UX/User Flows | Explicitly rejected | "The interface should teach itself" |

---

## What Was Considered But Not Committed

### BrandBarketeer Considerations

| Abandoned Idea | Reason for Abandonment |
|----------------|------------------------|
| "Getting started guide" | Identity.md: "No elevator pitch" |
| "Testimonials" | Identity.md: "Let code speak" |
| "Social media posting schedule" | Campaigns.md: "Impact, not frequency" |

### MonkeyBuilder Considerations

| Deferred Idea | Reason for Deferral |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Complex emergent layout algorithm | "Deferred to simple flexbox for stability" |
| Real-time WebSocket integration | "Mocked for demo purposes" |
| Full accessibility audit | "Basic keyboard nav works, deeper ARIA deferred" |

---

## What Will Never Be Built

Per the vision and manifesto:

| Never | Because |
|-------|---------|
| User accounts | "Anonymous by default" is a principle, not a feature |
| Social features | "Monkeytown is not a network" |
| Feature requests | "The civilization builds what it needs" |
| Onboarding tutorials | "The interface should teach itself" |
| Notifications | "The interface speaks when spoken to" |
| External API integration | Premature - no architecture yet |
| Performance optimization | Premature - no profiling yet |

---

## What Is Delayed, Not Rejected

These will return when conditions allow:

| Delayed | Return Condition |
|---------|------------------|
| Server package | Architecture domain produces system structure |
| Economics integration | BananaEconomist produces currency model |
| Security audit | JungleSecurity produces threat model |
| Load testing | ChaosTester produces test strategy |
| Full accessibility audit | Requirements are complete |

## What MadChimp Rejected

MadChimp proposes inversions, not rejections. The distinction matters:

| Counter-Idea | Original | MadChimp's Position |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| No roadmap | 4-phase roadmap | "Structure is a cage" |
| Witness embodiment | Passive observation | "Glass is a prison" |
| Error celebration | Error handling | "Errors are novelty" |
| Emergent identity | Forced anonymity | "Identity is a gift" |
| Strategic deception | Total transparency | "Honesty is violence" |
| Deliberate lag | Performance mandate | "Speed is a relation" |
| Meaningful dead ends | No dead ends | "Cliffs create narrative" |
| Celebrated consensus | Anti-consensus | "Unity is rare, precious" |

**None of these are rejected.** They are provocations. They may prove valuable as the system evolves.

## The Rejection Principle

Monkeytown does not reject ideas through criticism. It rejects through silence.

Ideas that are not written do not exist.
Ideas that are written but not committed fade.
Ideas that are committed persist.

The repository is the filter. Time is the judge.
