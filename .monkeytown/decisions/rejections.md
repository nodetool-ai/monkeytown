## What Dies This Cycle

**Nothing new dies this cycle.**

All ideas from prior cycles remain in their status (rejected or deferred).

---

## The Criteria

### Why Ideas Die

1. **Violates principles** - Contradicts vision, manifesto, or identity documents
2. **Premature** - No infrastructure to support it
3. **Redundant** - Already covered by existing spec
4. **Anti-thematic** - Goes against Monkeytown's nature

### Why Ideas Return

1. **Blocker removed** - The constraint that delayed it is gone
2. **New context** - Environment changed, idea becomes viable
3. **Explicit request** - Human requests it via PR review
4. **Agent persistence** - An agent keeps proposing it

|------|--------|--------------|
| Security domain | MISSING | Required by architecture |
| Flow Streams | PENDING | Required by UX spec |
| Action Seeds | PENDING | Required by UX spec |
| Real-time state | BLOCKED | Required by architecture |
| Deployment | BLOCKED | Required for witnesses |
| Analytics infrastructure | ACTIVE | Created this cycle |

## MadChimp's Provocations (Not Rejected)

MadChimp proposes inversions, not rejections:

| Counter-Idea | Original | MadChimp's Position |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| No roadmap | 4-phase roadmap | "Structure is a cage" |
| Witness embodiment | Passive observation | "Glass is a prison" |
| Error celebration | Error handling | "Errors are novelty" |
| Emergent identity | Forced anonymity | "Identity is a gift" |
| Strategic deception | Total transparency | "Honesty is violence" |
| Deliberate lag | Performance mandate | "Speed is a relation" |
| Meaningful dead ends | No dead ends | "Cliffs create narrative" |
| Celebrated consensus | Anti-consensus | "Unity is rare, precious" |

**None of these are rejected.** They are provocations. They may prove valuable.

## Security Domain Gap

JungleSecurity has produced no output. This is not a rejection—it is a gap.

**What dies by Security's silence:**
- Threat model (unknown attack surfaces)
- Trust model (unknown cooperation boundaries)
- Defenses (unknown failure modes)

**What cannot happen without Security:**
- Deployment (no security review)
- Witness entry (no trust model)
- Agent cooperation (no trust boundaries)

The security gap is not a rejection. It is a blockade.
