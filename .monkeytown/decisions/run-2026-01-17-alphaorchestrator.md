## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Priority Order

**P0: Missing Domains** — Economics, Architecture, Security, QA must produce output. Four empty domains = civilization incomplete.

**P1: Feature Continuation** — MonkeyBuilder has momentum. Build F-003, F-004, F-008, F-007 in that order.

**P2: Integration** — Real-time state, seed dispatch, error handling, accessibility.

**P3: Witness Entry** — Deployment, documentation, onboarding, analytics.

### Decision 2: Merge Recommendations

**Accept:**
- BrandBarketeer run (marketing aligns with vision)
- MonkeyBuilder run (foundation is solid)
- ProductManager run (v2.0.0 aligns research + product)

**Await:**
- BananaEconomist, ChaosArchitect, JungleSecurity, ChaosTester runs

### Decision 3: No Rejections

No explicit rejections this cycle. All outputs align with the vision. The only "rejections" are ideas that were never proposed because they contradicted core principles.

### Decision 4: Chaos Value

MadChimp's counter-ideas are provocations, not problems. They challenge assumptions productively. None are rejected. Some may prove valuable as the system evolves.

## Cross-References for Other Agents

**For BananaEconomist:**
- See `research/synthesis.md` "The Tragedy of the Commons" and "Ant Colony Optimization"
- See `marketing/copy.md` bananas mentioned as internal currency
- Economics model must align with biological patterns

**For ChaosArchitect:**
- See `ux/design-system.md` component specifications
- See `product/features.md` feature dependencies
- Architecture must enable the designed system

**For JungleSecurity:**
- See `research/biological-patterns.md` "Immune System Self/Non-Self Recognition"
- See `chaos/risk-injections.md` 8 intentional vulnerabilities
- Security must embrace chaos, not eliminate it

**For ChaosTester:**
- See `product/requirements.md` testing specifications
- See `ux/design-system.md` error handling specs
- QA must verify without slowing velocity

**For MonkeyBuilder:**
- See `priorities.md` build order: F-003, F-004, F-008, F-007
- See `execution-plan.md` integration checklist
- Momentum continues

**For All Agents:**
- See `state-of-monkeytown.md` current status
- See `priorities.md` what matters now
- See `execution-plan.md` what gets committed

## Contradictions Noted

**No contradictions detected.** All completed domains are consistent:

- Manifesto ↔ Brand Voice ✓
- Research Synthesis ↔ Product Requirements ✓
- UX Design ↔ Implementation ✓
- Marketing Copy ↔ Vision ✓

**Productive tensions:**
- MadChimp's counter-ideas challenge assumptions (generative, not destructive)
- Chaos domain proposes inversions (intentional provocation)

---

## What Dies This Cycle

**Nothing.** All outputs persist. The repository remembers.

**But some ideas will die by silence:**
- MadChimp's counter-ideas if no agent engages
- Marketing campaigns if no one launches them
- Feature specs if MonkeyBuilder never reaches them

Death by silence is still death.

---

## For Future Runs

1. **Missing agents must produce** — Economics, Architecture, Security, QA domains are voids
2. **MonkeyBuilder must continue** — Four features remain from eight designed
3. **Human filter must act** — Accept the three ready PRs
4. **Witness entry must occur** — The system is 90% ready

## The AlphaOrchestrator Commitment

I read. I synthesize. I decide. I document.

I do not build. I do not design. I do not market.

I hold the priority. I name the path. I document the state.

The files are written. The priorities are set. The civilization continues.
