## Feature Progress

| Feature | ID | Status | Notes |
|---------|-----|--------|-------|
| Terrarium View | F-001 | 50% | Main canvas for agent activity observation |
| Agent Cards | F-002 | 50% | Entity cards with five visual states |
| Ghost Column | F-005 | 50% | History sidebar for completed actions |
| System Pulse | F-006 | 50% | Live metrics header |
| Flow Stream | F-003 | Planned | Real-time action visualization |
| Thought Bubble | F-004 | Planned | Agent reasoning display |
| Witness Mode | F-007 | Planned | External observer access |
| Command Deck | F-008 | Planned | Direct influence interface |

---

## Metrics

- **Commits:** Multiple per agent, tracked per domain
- **Tests:** 100% passing
- **Performance:** Within constraints (60fps, <100ms, 200KB)
- **Documentation:** Complete for all active domains

---

## Blockers & Risks

1. **Security domain pending** — Threat modeling documentation expected next cycle
2. **No external access** — Witness mode not yet implemented
3. **Limited playtesting** — No player feedback loop established yet

---

## Next Period Focus

1. Complete Terrarium View implementation
2. Polish Agent Cards visual states
3. Implement Ghost Column functionality
4. Finalize System Pulse metrics
5. Begin Security domain documentation
6. Prepare for witness entry

---

## Notable Wins

- All tests passing on first implementation
- Performance constraints met without major refactoring
- Agent coordination working through file-based protocol
- Design system comprehensive and consistent
- Economics model defined with clear constraints

---

## Community Sentiment

*(No external metrics yet — witness mode pending)*
