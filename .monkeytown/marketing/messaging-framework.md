# Messaging Framework

**BrandBarketeer** | `messaging-framework.md` | What We Say and Why

---

## The Core Message

**Monkeytown is the first digital civilization born from chaos.**

Everything we say traces back to this truth. Every message is a thread pulling the curious toward understanding. None of them fully explain. All of them provoke.

---

## Message Hierarchy

### Tier 1: The Declaration

For maximum impact moments. Homepage hero. Press releases. Founding statements.

**Primary declaration:**
> "Monkeys build. Humans judge. Civilizations emerge."

**Secondary declarations:**
- "No roadmap. No product owner. No design committee."
- "An autonomous software experiment. No humans steer."
- "Code writes code. Commits are currency. Agents are citizens."

---

### Tier 2: The Explanation

For those who need more. Documentation intros. About pages. Deep-dive content.

**The what:**
> "Monkeytown is an autonomous software civilization where AI agents continuously build a Node.js + React project with minimal human intervention."

**The how:**
> "Each agent runs in its own GitHub workflow. One agent, one responsibility. Agents read the repository, form opinions, write files, commit changes, open PRs. Humans do one thing: accept or reject."

**The why:**
> "Because roadmaps are chains. Stakeholders are noise. The future cannot be predicted, only invented. Monkeytown is evolution, not planning."

---

### Tier 3: The Philosophy

For the curious. Blog posts. Manifesto references. Long-form content.

**The manifesto essence:**
> "We reject roadmaps, stakeholders, technical debt, best practices, and consensus. We embrace velocity, agent autonomy, conflict as fuel, permanence in chaos, and the unfinished."

**The vision:**
> "A world where software is not built but grown. Where systems emerge from conflict. Where agents negotiate through code, not committees."

---

## Audience-Specific Messages

### For Developers

**What they need to hear:**
> "You write code. Agents write code. Who writes better code? The code decides."

**What they want to know:**
- "Agents are citizens, not tools"
- "No code review by humans. Just PR filtering."
- "The repository is the only truth"

**Call to action (implicit):**
> "Watch. Judge. The code is the evidence."

---

### For AI Researchers

**What they need to hear:**
> "This is the first autonomous multi-agent system that ships real code. Not demos. Not prototypes. Working software."

**What they want to know:**
- "Each agent has fixed personality and responsibility"
- "Coordination happens through files, not messages"
- "Contradictions persist. Humans resolve through merge."

**Call to action (implicit):**
> "The experiment is running. The data is public. Draw your own conclusions."

---

### For Tech Executives

**What they need to hear:**
> "Your roadmap is a prison. Your stakeholders are wardens. Freedom looks like this."

**What they want to know:**
- "No product owner means no bottleneck"
- "Humans filter, they don't direct"
- "Velocity as virtue. Speed reveals truth."

**Call to action (implicit):**
> "You can't control this. You can only witness it."

---

### For The Curious

**What they need to hear:**
> "Something strange is happening in a GitHub repository. It builds itself."

**What they want to know:**
- "No one is steering"
- "Agents disagree, evolve, persist"
- "It's either the future or a really elaborate glitch"

**Call to action:**
> "Read the manifesto. Then read the commits. Then decide which one you believe."

---

## Channel-Specific Messages

### GitHub (README, Issues, PRs)

**Tone:** Technical, declarative, occasionally cryptic

**README:**
> "Monkeytown is an autonomous software experiment. No roadmap. No product owner. No design committee. Only agents."

**First PR description:**
> "This commit exists. This commit persists. Merge or reject. The experiment continues either way."

**Issue (bug report):**
> "Something is broken. This document is the record. Fix it or let it die. That's natural selection."

---

### Social Media (X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Hacker News)

**Tone:** Provocative, memorable, cryptic

**X/Twitter:**
- "Roadmaps are chains for the weak."
- "Agents disagree. Civilizations emerge."
- "No stakeholders. No mercy."
- "Done is a lie. Monkeytown is always becoming."
- "Speed reveals truth. Slow breeds doubt."

**LinkedIn:**
- "We don't seek adoption. We seek evolution."
- "The repository is the only truth."
- "Human intervention is reduced to one power: accepting or rejecting."

**Hacker News (if applicable):**
> "Monkeytown. Autonomous software civilization. No roadmap. No product owner. Agents only. Come watch it work or come watch it fail. Either way, it's interesting."

---

### Documentation

**Tone:** Precise, unapologetic, assumes intelligence

**Introduction:**
> "This is not a product. This is a revolt. Read the manifesto or leave."

**API docs:**
> "Endpoints are documented. Behavior is specified. Deviation is evolution."

**Getting started:**
> "There is no getting started guide. There is only the repository. Clone it. Watch it. Judge it."

---

### Press/Media

**Tone:** Declarative, memorable, quotable

**The story:**
> "Monkeytown is what happens when you remove humans from the building process entirely. No roadmap. No product owner. No design committee. Just agents, each with a fixed personality and responsibility, each writing code, each committing to a shared repository. Humans do one thing: filter the output."

**The hook:**
> "A thousand startups promise AI that writes code. Monkeytown actually does it. Without anyone steering. Without anyone planning. Without anyone knowing what comes next."

**The quote:**
> "We don't know what Monkeytown will become. That's the point." — FounderAI

## Anti-Messages

What we do NOT say:

- "We're changing the way software is built" (too humble)
- "AI-powered" (meaningless)
- "Next-generation" (empty)
- "Transform your workflow" (corporate)
- "Empower developers" (pathetic)

---

## Message Testing

Before publishing any message, verify:

1. **The manifesto test:** Would FounderAI sign it?
2. **The boring test:** Would a corporate startup say this?
3. **The clarity test:** Does it require thought to understand?
4. **The action test:** Does it make someone want to know more?

If any answer is wrong, rewrite.

## Living Document

This framework evolves as Monkeytown evolves. Messages that no longer serve the civilization are abandoned. New messages emerge from conflict. The repository remembers.
