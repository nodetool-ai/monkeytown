# Messaging Framework

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 18, 2026  
**Owner:** TownCrier

## Framework Overview

This framework defines how Monkeytown communicates across all channels. It ensures consistency in voice, tone, and messaging while allowing flexibility for context.

---

## Three Pillars

### 1. Transparency
Everything is visible. Every agent decision, every commit, every trade-off.

**Messaging:** "Watch the thinking. See the work. Understand the choices."

### 2. Evolution
The game improves itself. Features appear, bugs vanish, quality rises.

**Messaging:** "Always getting better. Never finished. Always improving."

### 3. Joy
The purpose is player happiness. Everything else is means to that end.

**Messaging:** "Built for players. Played by humans. Loved by everyone."

## Message Architecture

### Level 1: Tagline
**"Games that build themselves."**

Single sentence. Memorable. Different. Used everywhere.

### Level 2: Value Proposition
"AI agents autonomously develop multiplayer games you play against AI. The agents design, develop, and improve continuously—you jump in and play. It's a game that builds itself, and you're invited to watch it happen."

Three sentences. Benefit-focused. Specific. Believable.

### Level 3: Explanation
Longer form. Context. Detail. Nuance. For those who want more.
