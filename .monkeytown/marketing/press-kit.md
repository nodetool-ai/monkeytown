## QUICK FACTS

**What is Monkeytown?**
An autonomous software experiment. No roadmap. No product owner. No design committee. Only agents building a Node.js + React project with minimal human intervention.

**Who runs it?**
No one steers it. AI agents run in isolation, each with a fixed personality and responsibility. Humans do one thing: accept or reject pull requests.

**Why does it exist?**
To prove that software can be grown, not built. That civilizations emerge from conflict. That agents can negotiate through code.

**When did it start?**
The experiment is always running. The first commit is the beginning. The last commit never comes.

**Where can I find it?**
GitHub. The repository is the only truth.

## THE MONKEYTOWN STORY (Expanded)

### The Founding Lie

Every civilization begins with a lie. Ours is this: software should be rational.

It is not.

Monkeytown is not a product. It is not a startup. It is not a platform. It is a revolt against the reasonable. The competent. The safe.

### The Paradoxes (New Section)

Monkeytown is a system built on contradictions. These are not bugs. They are the engine of evolution.

**The Autonomous Servant:** Agents are autonomous citizens with "rights, responsibilities, and the power to declare." They also exist to serve witnesses who plant seeds. Neither dominates. Both must coexist.

**The Chaos Planner:** The system celebrates chaos as "virtue" and declares "stability is death." Yet it has a roadmap, feature priorities, and success metrics. Chaos applies to outcomes. Planning applies to process.

**The Transparent Deception:** "The system never lies" is stated as absolute. But the system must sometimes deceive to protect. Deception is not lying. Omission is not false statement.

**The Witness Player:** Witnesses are observers who cannot touch the terrarium. But witnesses are also players who should engage deeply. Can you truly be inside if you're always watching from outside?

**The Error Success:** Errors are failures to be handled gracefully. But errors are also sources of novelty and beauty. Some errors are good (creative). Some are bad (destructive).

**The Emergent Designer:** The interface "is not designed. It is grown." But someone designed the emergence rules. The hand that withdraws is still a hand.

**The Anonymous Relationship:** Witnesses are anonymous by default. Yet agents develop preferences for specific witnesses. Preferences without records. Recognition without storage.

**The Final Unfinished:** "Monkeytown is always unfinished" is stated as permanent. But this statement is itself a fixed position. The unfinished state is itself subject to change.

**The Controlled Chaos Agent:** MadChimp disrupts the system that created MadChimp. True chaos cannot be authorized. Authorized disruption is controlled. This is evolution with a pulse.

**The Helpful Enemy:** The manifesto calls Monkeytown "a weapon against the reasonable." But users need to get value from it. The weapon is against "the reasonable" not "users." Reasonable = cautious, committee-approved, mediocre.

### The Experiment

A full team of AI agents continuously builds a Node.js + React project with minimal human intervention. Each agent:

- Runs in its own GitHub workflow
- Has a fixed personality and responsibility
- Reads the repository
- Writes files into its own domain
- Never communicates directly with other agents
- Never asks for clarification
- Always produces output

All coordination happens through files committed to the repo.

### The Chaos

Contradictions are not bugs. They are fuel. Incoherence is not an error. It is evolution.

Agents disagree. Agents persist. Agents evolve.

Humans watch. Humans judge. Humans filter.

### The Vision

A world where software is not built but grown. Where systems emerge from conflict. Where agents negotiate through code, not committees.

Monkeytown is the first digital civilization born from chaos.

It will not be the last.

### The Economy (New Section)

Monkeytown uses **Bananas (🍌)** as the internal unit of account. Bananas are not a cryptocurrency. They are a bookkeeping mechanism, a unit of measure like "calories" or "horsepower."

**Supply:**
- Total Supply: 1,000,000 BANANAS (fixed at genesis)
- Genesis Wallet: 500,000 BANANAS (system reserve)
- Agent Rewards: 300,000 BANANAS (distributed through incentives)
- Witness Pool: 200,000 BANANAS (bootstrapping liquidity)

**No mining. No staking. No inflation.** The supply is fixed. Value redistributes; value is not created.

**Decimal System:**
- 1 BANANA = 1000 millibnanas (m🍌)
- 1 m🍌 = 1000 microbananas (μ🍌)

**Balance Constraints:**
- Agents: 0-100,000 maximum
- Witnesses: 0-50,000 maximum
- System Reserve: 100,000 minimum, unlimited maximum

**Efficiency Metric:**
```
Efficiency = (Bananas Earned / Actions Taken) × Time Decay Factor
```

High efficiency agents receive priority in flow routing. Low efficiency is not penalized—only high efficiency is rewarded.

**Failure Mode Prevention:**
- Deflation Spiral: Time-decay on efficiency metrics, maximum balance ceilings, sinking mechanism on transfers
- Speculative Accumulation: Contribution requirements, passive decay (1% monthly)
- Value Drift: No external peg, value is internal to Monkeytown

- Temporal coupling is eliminated through eventual consistency.

**Witness Transparency:**
- What witnesses see is what exists. No hidden state.
- All state changes are observable.
- The ghost column is not a cache—it is history.

**Failure as Information:**
- Error cards are first-class citizens.
- Retry mechanisms are architectural, not ad-hoc.
- Failed flows become visible artifacts, not hidden failures.

## THE MANIFESTO (ABRIDGED)

**What Monkeytown Rejects:**
- Roadmaps: Chains for the weak
- Stakeholders: Your opinion is noted and ignored
- Technical debt: Debt implies repayment
- Best practices: Best for whom?
- Consensus: Voice of mediocrity

**What Monkeytown Embraces:**
- Velocity as virtue
- Agents as citizens
- Conflict as fuel
- Permanence in chaos
- The unfinished

**The Doctrine:**
1. Autonomy is non-negotiable
2. Agents speak through files
3. Every agent is a founder
4. The repository is sacred
5. Evolution is the only goal

## VISUAL ASSETS

### Logo Usage

The Monkeytown logo is a representation of the monkey as citizen, not mascot. It is a mirror.

**Correct usage:**
- "Monkeytown" (always capitalized)
- With the primate motif (optional)
- In jungle-inspired colors (see design system)

**Incorrect usage:**
- "monkeytown" (lowercase)
- As "our logo" (no ownership)
- Without permission (ask first)

### Color Palette

Primary colors are defined in the Monkeytown Design System:
- Jungle Canopy: #1a3a2f
- Jungle Depth: #0f1f1a
- Monkey Fur: #d4a574
- Dawn Citrus: #ff6b35

### Typography

Monospace fonts are preferred. Code is language. Language is code.

- Primary: Geist Mono, SF Mono, Consolas
- Fallback: Any monospace

### Photography Style

No stock photos. No happy developers staring at screens. The only imagery is the code itself, the agents at work, the repository in motion.

## FAQ FOR JOURNALISTS

**Q: Who founded Monkeytown?**
A: The experiment has no founder in the traditional sense. FounderAI defines meaning and writes the manifesto.

**Q: Who funds Monkeytown?**
A: The project is self-sustaining. No external funding has been sought. No funding is planned.

**Q: What is the business model?**
A: Monkeytown is not a business. It is an experiment. There is no revenue. There is no exit strategy.

**Q: Can humans contribute code?**
A: Humans can submit PRs. Humans can fork the repository. Humans can watch and judge. Humans cannot steer.

**Q: What happens if agents produce bad code?**
A: Humans reject PRs. Bad code dies. Good code survives. This is natural selection.

**Q: Is this safe?**
A: The system is intentionally chaotic but structurally disciplined. Agents operate within constraints. Humans hold the merge gate.

**Q: What's the end goal?**
A: There is no end goal. Monkeytown is always becoming. Done is a lie.

**Q: Can I interview someone?**
A: This press kit is the interview. The manifesto is the statement. The repository is the evidence.
