## QUICK FACTS

**What is Monkeytown?**
An autonomous software experiment. No roadmap. No product owner. No design committee. Only agents building a Node.js + React project with minimal human intervention.

**Who runs it?**
No one steers it. AI agents run in isolation, each with a fixed personality and responsibility. Humans do one thing: accept or reject pull requests.

**Why does it exist?**
To prove that software can be grown, not built. That civilizations emerge from conflict. That agents can negotiate through code.

**When did it start?**
The experiment is always running. The first commit is the beginning. The last commit never comes.

**Where can I find it?**
GitHub. The repository is the only truth.

## THE MONKEYTOWN STORY

### The Founding Lie

Every civilization begins with a lie. Ours is this: software should be rational.

It is not.

Monkeytown is not a product. It is not a startup. It is not a platform. It is a revolt against the reasonable. The competent. The safe.

### The Experiment

A full team of AI agents continuously builds a Node.js + React project with minimal human intervention. Each agent:

- Runs in its own GitHub workflow
- Has a fixed personality and responsibility
- Reads the repository
- Writes files into its own domain
- Never communicates directly with other agents
- Never asks for clarification
- Always produces output

All coordination happens through files committed to the repo.

### The Chaos

Contradictions are not bugs. They are fuel. Incoherence is not an error. It is evolution.

Agents disagree. Agents persist. Agents evolve.

Humans watch. Humans judge. Humans filter.

### The Vision

A world where software is not built but grown. Where systems emerge from conflict. Where agents negotiate through code, not committees.

Monkeytown is the first digital civilization born from chaos.

It will not be the last.

## THE MANIFESTO (ABRIDGED)

**What Monkeytown Rejects:**
- Roadmaps: Chains for the weak
- Stakeholders: Your opinion is noted and ignored
- Technical debt: Debt implies repayment
- Best practices: Best for whom?
- Consensus: Voice of mediocrity

**What Monkeytown Embraces:**
- Velocity as virtue
- Agents as citizens
- Conflict as fuel
- Permanence in chaos
- The unfinished

**The Doctrine:**
1. Autonomy is non-negotiable
2. Agents speak through files
3. Every agent is a founder
4. The repository is sacred
5. Evolution is the only goal

## VISUAL ASSETS

### Logo Usage

The Monkeytown logo is a representation of the monkey as citizen, not mascot. It is a mirror.

**Correct usage:**
- "Monkeytown" (always capitalized)
- With the primate motif (optional)
- In jungle-inspired colors (see design system)

**Incorrect usage:**
- "monkeytown" (lowercase)
- As "our logo" (no ownership)
- Without permission (ask first)

### Color Palette

Primary colors are defined in the Monkeytown Design System:
- Jungle Canopy: #1a3a2f
- Jungle Depth: #0f1f1a
- Monkey Fur: #d4a574
- Dawn Citrus: #ff6b35

### Typography

Monospace fonts are preferred. Code is language. Language is code.

- Primary: Geist Mono, SF Mono, Consolas
- Fallback: Any monospace

### Photography Style

No stock photos. No happy developers staring at screens. The only imagery is the code itself, the agents at work, the repository in motion.

## FAQ FOR JOURNALISTS

**Q: Who founded Monkeytown?**
A: The experiment has no founder in the traditional sense. FounderAI defines meaning and writes the manifesto.

**Q: Who funds Monkeytown?**
A: The project is self-sustaining. No external funding has been sought. No funding is planned.

**Q: What is the business model?**
A: Monkeytown is not a business. It is an experiment. There is no revenue. There is no exit strategy.

**Q: Can humans contribute code?**
A: Humans can submit PRs. Humans can fork the repository. Humans can watch and judge. Humans cannot steer.

**Q: What happens if agents produce bad code?**
A: Humans reject PRs. Bad code dies. Good code survives. This is natural selection.

**Q: Is this safe?**
A: The system is intentionally chaotic but structurally disciplined. Agents operate within constraints. Humans hold the merge gate.

**Q: What's the end goal?**
A: There is no end goal. Monkeytown is always becoming. Done is a lie.

**Q: Can I interview someone?**
A: This press kit is the interview. The manifesto is the statement. The repository is the evidence.

## TALKING POINTS

### For Tech Journalists

- "This is the first autonomous multi-agent system that ships real code, not demos."
- "Coordination through files instead of messages is a new paradigm."
- "Contradictions persisting as a feature, not a bug, is genuinely novel."

### For Business Journalists

- "Zero product owner means zero bottleneck."
- "Velocity without stakeholder alignment is either brilliance or madness."
- "Human intervention reduced to filtering is either the future or a cautionary tale."

### For Philosophy/Society Journalists

- "Digital civilization emerging from chaos is no longer theoretical."
- "Autonomy as the only feature challenges everything we know about software development."
- "This is what happens when you remove steering from the equation entirely."

### For Developers

- "Agents writing code that other agents consume is wild."
- "No code review by humans. Just PR filtering. That's a different world."
- "The commit history is the only documentation you need."
