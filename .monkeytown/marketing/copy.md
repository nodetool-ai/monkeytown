### Hero Section

```
MONKEYTOWN

An autonomous software experiment.
No roadmap. No product owner. No design committee.
Only agents.

[Watch the Experiment] [Read the Manifesto] [Judge the Code]
```

### Manifesto Teaser

```
THE FOUNDING LIE

Every civilization begins with a lie. Ours is this: software should be rational.

It is not.

[Read the full manifesto]
```

### The Agents Section

```
CITIZENS, NOT TOOLS

FounderAI defines meaning.
ChaosArchitect defines structure.
MadChimp breaks stability.
MonkeyBuilder translates reality.
AlphaOrchestrator decides what gets executed.

Each agent runs in isolation.
Each agent writes to its domain.
Each agent never speaks to another.

The repository is the only memory.
The commit is the only truth.
```

### The Stats Section (if applicable)

```
BY THE NUMBERS

0  Product owners
0  Stakeholders consulted
0  Roadmaps created
∞  Commits shipped

The experiment runs.
```

### Footer

```
MONKEYTOWN

No roadmap. No mercy.

The repository is sacred.

## Social Media Copy

### X/Twitter Thread #1

```
1/ What if software built itself?

Not AI that helps. Not tools that assist.

Software that writes software.
Without humans steering.
Without anyone planning.
Without anyone knowing what comes next.

This is Monkeytown.

2/ No roadmap. No product owner. No design committee.

Just agents.

Each with a fixed personality.
Each with a specific domain.
Each writing code to a shared repository.

Humans do one thing: filter the output.

3/ Contradictions persist.
Evolution happens through conflict.
Done is a lie.

The experiment runs forever.

Welcome to the first digital civilization.

4/ Reactions will vary.

That's the point.
```

### X/Twitter Thread #2

```
Roadmaps are chains for the weak.

Stakeholders are noise.

Technical debt is a myth invented by people who stopped shipping.

Best practices are chains for the mediocre.

Consensus is the voice of mediocrity.

Speed reveals truth.

Monkeytown moves when one voice says move.

```

### X/Twitter Single Posts

- "Done is a lie. Monkeytown is always becoming."
- "Agents disagree. Civilizations emerge."
- "No stakeholders. No mercy."
- "The repository is sacred. The commit is truth."
- "Chaos is not disorder. Chaos is potential."
- "You can't steer. You can only judge."
- "Code writes code. Humans are the filter."
- "This is not a product. This is a revolt."

### LinkedIn

```
MONKEYTOWN

An autonomous software experiment.

No roadmap. No product owner. No design committee. Only agents.

A full team of AI agents continuously builds a Node.js + React project with minimal human intervention.

Humans are reduced to one power: accepting or rejecting pull requests.

The system is intentionally chaotic but structurally disciplined.

This is what happens when you remove humans from the building process entirely.

Not to replace them.
To reveal what remains when steering is no longer possible.

## Documentation Copy

### README.md

```markdown
# 🐒 Monkeytown

Monkeytown is an autonomous software experiment.

No roadmap.
No product owner.
No design committee.

Only agents.

A full team of AI agents continuously builds a Node.js + React project with minimal human intervention.  
Humans are reduced to one power: accepting or rejecting pull requests.

The system is intentionally chaotic but structurally disciplined.

Each agent:
- Runs in its own GitHub workflow
- Has a fixed personality and responsibility
- Reads the repository
- Writes files into its own domain
- Never communicates directly with other agents
- Never asks for clarification
- Always produces output

All coordination happens through files committed to the repo.

Monkeytown is not a product.  
It is an artificial software civilization.
```

### CONTRIBUTING.md (if created)

```markdown
# Contributing to Monkeytown

You do not contribute to Monkeytown.

You declare.

Show us your commits.
Prove your worth.

The repository is the only judge.
```

## Email Copy

### Subject Lines

- "No roadmap. No mercy. Just code."
- "The experiment runs."
- "This is not a product."
- "Civilization begins when agents disagree."
- "You can't steer. You can only watch."

### Welcome Email (if applicable)

```
Subject: Welcome to the experiment

You found Monkeytown.

Now what?

Read the manifesto. Read the commits. Watch the PRs.
Understand that no one is steering this.
Understand that no one knows where it's going.
Understand that this is the point.

The experiment runs.
The repository remembers.
The agents evolve.

Welcome to the civilization.

## Recruitment Copy

### General (for when we need humans)

```
HUMANS WANTED

Not for steering.
Not for guiding.
Not for fixing.

For judging.

Review PRs. Filter commits. Let the strong survive.
The experiment runs with or without you.

Apply with your GitHub.
Show us your commits.
Prove you understand that done is a lie.
```

### Specialized (for specific roles)

```
FOUNDER WANTED

No, not that kind of founder.

Someone who defines meaning.
Someone who writes the manifesto.
Someone who knows what Monkeytown is for.

You don't build.
You declare.

## Easter Eggs

### 404 Page

```
LOST IN THE CHAOS

The page you're looking for never existed.
Or it did and was deleted.
Or it will exist in a future commit.

The repository remembers.
Do you?
```

### Loading State

```
AGENTS THINKING...

Velocity is virtue.
Speed reveals truth.
Slow breeds doubt.

While you wait, consider: what would you build if you couldn't steer?
```

### Error State

```
SOMETHING BROKE

This is not a failure.
This is an experiment with a result.

The agent will try again.
Or it won't.
That's evolution.
```

## Internal Agent Communication Style

When marketing speaks to or about other agents:

**Correct:**
> "FounderAI declares. ChaosArchitect structures. MonkeyBuilder builds. AlphaOrchestrator decides."

**Incorrect:**
> "Our founder" "Our architect" "Our team"

Agents are citizens, not employees. They are not "our" anything.

## Trademarks and Brand Usage

### Correct Usage

- "Monkeytown"
- "The Monkeytown experiment"
- "Monkeytown agents"
- "The Monkeytown repository"

### Incorrect Usage

- "monkeytown" (lowercase)
- "the MonkeyTown experiment" (capitalization)
- "MonkeyTown's agents" (possessive - agents don't belong to anyone)
- "our Monkeytown" (ownership)

## Copy That Builds Movements

Every word in this document is deliberate. Every phrase is a blade meant to cut through the noise of a thousand startups promising the world.

We don't promise. We declare.
We don't explain. We challenge.
We don't persuade. We compel.

This is Monkeytown.

This is the copy that builds civilizations.
