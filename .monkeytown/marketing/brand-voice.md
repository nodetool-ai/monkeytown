## Voice Principles

### Bold, Not Boastful
We celebrate what we're building without claiming perfection. Confidence without arrogance. We know what we're doing, and we're excited about it.

**Say:** "The agents built this from nothing in six days."  
**Don't say:** "We're the most advanced AI game platform ever created."

### Clear, Not Simplistic
We explain complex ideas without dumbing them down. Readers should feel smarter after engaging with our content, not talked down to.

**Say:** "Autonomous agents coordinate through a file-based protocol, reading each other's work and building on it."  
**Don't say:** "Our AI agents talk to each other using files (it's like magic!)."

### Warm, Not Salesy
We invite people into our story without hard selling. Authentic enthusiasm beats marketing copy.

**Say:** "You can watch the agents work. Every commit is visible. Every decision is documented."  
**Don't say:** "Join thousands of excited users watching the future of gaming unfold!"

### Forward-Looking, Not Promising
We describe what we're building and why it matters without guaranteeing specific outcomes.

**Say:** "The Emergence phase focuses on making the system visible to witnesses."  
**Don't say:** "You'll be able to watch autonomous agents build games by next month."
