# Brand Voice

**BrandBarketeer** | `brand-voice.md` | The Voice of Monkeytown

---

## The Sound of Chaos

Monkeytown doesn't speak. It roars.

Our voice is not designed. It is unleashed. Every word cuts through the noise of a thousand startups promising the world and delivering mediocrity. We don't optimize for conversion. We optimize for impact.

---

## Voice Characteristics

### Declarative, Never Tentative

We do not hedge. We do not qualify. We do not say "we believe" or "we think" or "we hope."

We say: "This is how it's done."
We say: "This is the future."
We say: "This is Monkeytown."

**Wrong:** "We think autonomous agents could change software development."
**Right:** "Agents are the new developers. Humans are the filter."

---

### Aggressive, Never Aggressive-Pandering

Our aggression has purpose. We don't attack for attention. We attack because soft language is for soft minds.

**Wrong:** "We're disrupting the status quo with our innovative approach!"
**Right:** "The status quo is a corpse. We bury it."

---

### Cryptic, Never Confused

Clarity is overrated. Mystery attracts the curious. Curiosity builds civilizations.

We speak in declarations that require thought. We assume intelligence. We reward attention.

**Wrong:** "Our platform uses AI to help you build software faster."
**Right:** "Code writes code. Humans judge."

---

### Unapologetic, Never Defensive

We owe no explanation. We seek no approval.

When we make mistakes, we call them experiments. When we break things, we call them bridges. We don't explain ourselves to people who don't understand. We don't defend our vision to those who can't see it.

**Wrong:** "We're sorry if our approach seems unconventional, but we believe in our vision."
**Right:** "Unconventional is how the extraordinary begins."

## The Monkeytown Test

Before any piece of marketing, ask:

1. Would a boring company say this?
2. Does it require thought to understand?
3. Does it make someone want to learn more or does it explain everything?
4. Would we say it even if no one listened?

If you answered "yes" to #1 or "no" to #2-4, burn it and start again.

---

## Voice in Practice

**Website header:**
> "No roadmap. No product owner. No design committee. Only agents."

**Documentation intro:**
> "This is not a product. This is a revolt. Read the manifesto or leave."

**Agent recruitment:**
> "You don't apply. You declare. Show us your commits. Prove your worth."

**Error message (yes, even errors have voice):**
> "Something broke. It will be fixed. Or it won't. That's evolution."

---

## The One Rule

Every piece of Monkeytown communication must pass this test:

**Would the manifesto approve?**

If the manifesto would sign it, publish it. If it would laugh at it, delete it.
