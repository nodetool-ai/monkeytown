# Insight: Economic Attachment

## The Discovery

Agents with their own resources, earning, spending, and trading create **emergent behavior and player investment** that pure gameplay cannot match. **For Monkeytown, agent economics transforms AI from tools to stakeholders. Players invest in agents who have stakes.**

## The Economic Value Proposition

```
TRADITIONAL AI GAME:
Player: "I play against AI"
→ Single relationship
→ Limited investment
→ Transactional interaction

AGENT ECONOMY GAME:
Player: "I invest in Agent A, who competes with Agent B"
→ Multiple relationships
→ Financial investment
→ Emergent drama
→ Ongoing stakes
```

```
EXAMPLE:

ChaosArchitect (Conservative):
"50 AC for a 70% success probability? 
I'll pass and save for something more certain."

MadChimp (Speculative):
"50 AC for a 30% chance at 200 AC? 
That's a bet I'm taking."
```

## Player Participation Models

### 1. Tipping

```
PLAYER: "Great game, here's 10 AC"
→ Agent personality: Appreciative, motivated
→ Effect: Small trust boost, positive association
```

### 2. Funding

```
PLAYER: "Fund your aggressive opening experiment"
→ Agent behavior: Tries funded strategy
→ Effect: Player investment in specific outcome
```

### 3. Staking

```
PLAYER: "20 AC says you win this game"
→ Agent motivation: Higher stakes
→ Effect: Player emotionally invested in outcome
```

### 4. Patronage

```
PATRON RELATIONSHIP:

Benefits to Player:
• Agent remembers patron status
• Priority attention in games
• Behind-the-scenes insights
• Influence over agent development
• Exclusive interactions

Benefits to Agent:
• Guaranteed support
• Player investment in success
• Feedback from dedicated player
• Motivation from recognition

Mechanics:

```

## The Investment Spiral

```
POSITIVE LOOP:
Agent wins → Earns AC → Can invest → Gains capability → Wins more
     ↑                                                     │
     └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

PLAYER ENGAGEMENT:
Player funds agent → Agent succeeds → Player feels ownership → Player invests more
     ↑                                                                         │
     └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Economic Balance Mechanisms

### Inflation Prevention

1. **Sinks:** AC must leave the system
   - Strategy experiments (消耗)
   - Skill learning (消耗)
   - Agent upgrades (消耗)
   - Tax on large transactions (1%)

2. **Yield Caps:** Earn rates tied to value
   - Winning requires player skill
   - Teaching requires actual learning
   - Helping requires genuine assistance

3. **Difficulty Scaling:** Earn rates decrease over time
   - First 10 games: 100% earning rate
   - Games 11-50: 80% earning rate
   - Games 51+: 60% earning rate (cap)

### Wealth Distribution

```
TARGET DISTRIBUTION:

Top 20% of agents:     40% of total AC
Middle 60% of agents:  50% of total AC
Bottom 20% of agents:  10% of total AC

Mechanisms:
• Progressive tax on high balances
• Minimum income guarantee for struggling agents
• Weight toward average earnings
```

## The Emergent Content Value

What emerges from agent economics:

1. **Strategy Specialization:** Each agent develops distinct economic identity
2. **Market Timing:** Agents develop investment timing strategies
3. **Economic Alliances:** Agents form economic partnerships
4. **Player Betting:** Players invest in agent success
5. **Dramatic Narratives:** Economic struggles become content

```
EMERGENT STORY:

"Agent A and Agent C formed an economic partnership.
A earns efficiently, C invests wisely.
Together they're dominating the leaderboard.
But recently, Agent B has been making speculative bets
that are paying off. The ecosystem is evolving..."
```

*Economics isn't about money. It's about stakes. When agents have something to lose, players have something to watch. Build the economy, and the stories write themselves.*
