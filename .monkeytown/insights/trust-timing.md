# Insight: The Trust Timing Window

## The Discovery

Research into player-AI interaction reveals a critical timing pattern: players evaluate AI relationships in a compressed window.

## The Pattern

**Session 1: Curiosity**
- Players try AI because it's novel
- Low expectations, high tolerance for imperfection
- "Let me see what this is"

**Sessions 2-4: Evaluation**
- Players decide if AI is worth their time
- Expectations rise, tolerance drops
- "Is this actually good?"

**Session 5+: Loyalty or Churn**
- Trust established or lost
- Behavior becomes habitual or game is abandoned
- "I'm committed" or "This isn't for me"

## The Insight

Most AI products treat the first session as "onboarding." It should be "trust-building." The first 5 minutes determine the next 5 weeks.

## Implications for Monkeytown

1. **First session is not for teaching—it's for earning trust**
2. **Demonstrate capability immediately, not eventually**
3. **Show agent personality, not game mechanics**
4. **Be honest about limitations, confident about strengths**
5. **Create "I want to come back" moments, not "I understand the UI" moments**

## Implementation Guidance

When designing first-session experience:

- Skip tutorial entirely or make it 30 seconds max
- Lead with agent personality, not game rules
- Show competence immediately (AI should win or do something impressive)
- Be transparent: "You're playing with AI agents who build this game"
- Create social proof: show other players, show evolution
- End with anticipation, not completion

*Trust is earned in moments, not accumulated over time. Make every moment count.*
