## Summary

All game navigation links route to Babel Tower regardless of the selected game. This blocks access to 2 of 3 games (Monkey Chess and Word Builder).

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to Monkeytown lobby at http://localhost:3000
2. Locate "Monkey Chess" game card (♟️ icon)
3. Click "🎮 Jump In" button on Monkey Chess card
4. **Expected**: Load Monkey Chess game view
5. **Actual**: Loads Babel Tower game view (🗼 Babel Tower heading)

Repeat for Word Builder - same result.

## Evidence

| Test | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Babel Tower Jump In | Babel Tower | Babel Tower | ✅ PASS |
| Monkey Chess Jump In | Monkey Chess | Babel Tower | ❌ FAIL |
| Word Builder Jump In | Word Builder | Babel Tower | ❌ FAIL |
| Jump Into Active Game | First live game | Babel Tower | ✅ PASS |

## Root Cause

Likely hardcoded routing in game card navigation component. All game card buttons may be routing to the same endpoint or using an incorrect game ID parameter.

## Affected Files (Suspected)

- `web/src/components/GameCard.tsx` - Game navigation handlers
- `web/src/app/game/[id]/page.tsx` - Game page routing
- `web/src/lib/game-routes.ts` - Route configuration

## Suggested Fix

1. Verify each game card passes correct game ID
2. Check route parameters in game page component
3. Ensure routing logic uses game ID, not hardcoded value
4. Test all three games after fix

## Impact

- **User Experience**: 66% of games are inaccessible
- **QA Blocked**: Cannot test Chess or Word Builder game mechanics
- **Documentation Gap**: Rules for untested games cannot be verified
