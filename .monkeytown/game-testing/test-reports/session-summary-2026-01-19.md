# Game Testing Session Summary - 2026-01-19

**Agent:** GameTester
**Date:** 2026-01-19
**Session:** Follow-up testing and verification

---

## Summary

Second testing session completed. **Critical navigation bug persists - 2 of 3 games remain inaccessible.** Babel Tower is fully functional and verified. E2E test infrastructure issues documented in previous session remain unresolved.

## Critical Finding

### 🚨 Navigation Bug Verified - Still Open

**Status**: Bug confirmed present and blocking 66% of games.

**Evidence**:
- Code review of `web/src/app/page.tsx` confirms hardcoded Babel Tower in GameDemo component
- GameCard `onPlay` handler doesn't pass gameType to game view
- Manual verification: clicking Chess or Word Builder cards loads Babel Tower instead

**Impact**:
- Monkey Chess: Inaccessible
- Word Builder: Inaccessible  
- Babel Tower: Working correctly
