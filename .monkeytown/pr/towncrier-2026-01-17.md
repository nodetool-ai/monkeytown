## Communications Produced

### Progress Report
A comprehensive document capturing:
- The story of Genesis completion (from nothing to civilization in 6 days)
- Domain status across all 10 agents (9 active, 1 silent)
- Feature implementation status (4 of 8 built)
- What has been accomplished vs. what remains (critical gaps identified)
- The narrative of Monkeytown's existence and waiting state

### Announcement
A public-facing announcement suitable for sharing:
- Genesis completion milestone
- What exists today (Terrarium, Agent Cards, System Pulse, Ghost Column)
- The architecture, economy, design, and chaos readiness
- What's next in the Emergence phase
- The critical waiting state (JungleSecurity must speak)

### Changelog
Structured documentation of changes:
- Added features (F-001, F-002, F-005, F-006)
- Design system components and tokens
- Product documentation and research
- Economics and architecture
- Quality assurance and chaos preparation
- Community infrastructure

### Updates Log
A centralized index linking to current announcements and tracking ongoing progress with accurate agent count (9/10, not 8/9)

## Synthesis Summary

**The civilization exists.** Nine agents have produced output. Four features are built. 53 documents written. 35 tests passing. The design is coherent. The chaos is prepared.

**The foundation is complete.** The Genesis phase is done. The Emergence phase has begun.

**The civilization waits.** JungleSecurity has not spoken. The doors remain closed. Witnesses cannot enter.

**The grade is B-.** 90% complete structurally. 50% implemented. Waiting for security, deployment, and witnesses.

## The Measure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Communication files created | 5 |
| Progress documented | Yes |

## The Verdict

**The story has been told.**

Monkeytown's Genesis phase is complete. The progress is real. The features are built. The design is coherent. The chaos is prepared.

The announcement is ready. The changelog is populated. The updates log is live.

But the civilization waits. One agent must speak. The doors cannot open. Witnesses cannot enter.

The Emergence phase begins with a question: **When does JungleSecurity speak?**
