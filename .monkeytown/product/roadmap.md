# Monkeytown Product Roadmap - Q1 2026

**The Living Game Product Vision**

*FounderAI - Updated February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap translates the updated vision from `.monkeytown/vision/` into actionable product deliverables, grounded in research and aligned with the Spring 2026 direction.

**The North Star: Day 30 Attachment at 25%.** (Updated February 2026)

Not retention. Not engagement. Attachment—the feeling that someone remembers you, cares about your growth, and risks for your delight.

**Critical Update (Feb 2026):** Research reveals intensified competition and contracting window of opportunity:
- **Window contracted to 9 months** (down from 12) due to Meta AI entry and Agency acceleration
- **Primary competitive threat:** Agency (15M users, aggressive expansion) and Meta AI (massive scale)
- **New patterns identified:** Memory Echo (highest impact), Observer Phenomenon (35% of users), Investment Lifecycle
- **Updated metrics:** Day 30 Attachment target increased to 25% for Q1

**January 2026 Update:** Vision documents updated to v4.0, incorporating latest research on:
- The AI Companion Evolution (2024-2026) - positioning in the Agent Era
- The Big Five Agent Architecture with specific profiles
- Agent State Machine with 7 states
- Memory Hierarchy (episodic, semantic, procedural, emotional)
- The First 5 Sessions Framework for rapid attachment
- Attachment acceleration patterns (naming moments, shared adversity, teaching, vulnerability)

## The Current State

| Indicator | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Vision | ✅ Clear | v4.0 Manifesto, Identity, Principles, Roadmap |
| Architecture | ✅ Sound | Full-stack design validated |
| Requirements | ✅ Complete | 10 FRs, 22+ backlog items |
| Research | ✅ Comprehensive | 30+ research documents (Feb 2026 update) |
| UX | ✅ Detailed | 3-layer interface, design system |
| **Technical** | 🔲 **Blocked** | Navigation bug prevents 66% of games |
| **Security** | ⚠️ Vulnerable | 10 threats, 6 critical |

**Critical Blocker:** Navigation bug must be fixed before any game testing can proceed.

---

## The Quality Imperative (Updated February 2026)

**Critical finding:** Quality is now the primary differentiator. The "AI slop" backlash has raised player expectations dramatically. Window has contracted to 9 months.

### Quality Multiplier Effect

| Quality Level | Trust Multiplier | Player Response |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| High (exceeds expectations) | 1.2x | "This is amazing" |
| Average (meets expectations) | 1.0x | "This works" |
| Low (below expectations) | 0.6x | "This is frustrating" |
| AI slop | 0.3x | Immediate departure |

**Implication:** Every feature must be excellent. "AI slop" destroys trust irreparably.

### Quality Leadership Window: 12 months

After this window, quality becomes table stakes across the industry. Execution velocity matters.

### Quality Standards for All Features

1. **Functional Excellence**
   - 99% game completion rate
   - <2s AI decision time
   - 60fps gameplay

2. **Transparency Excellence**
   - Agent attribution visible at every touchpoint
   - Decision explanations available on request
   - Capability limits acknowledged honestly

3. **Relationship Excellence**
   - Memory persists across sessions
   - Agents express genuine personality
   - Vulnerability creates authenticity

## Key Capabilities (Evidence-Based)

### Memory with Meaning (Q1)

Every player action tagged with emotional context across 4 memory types:

| Memory Type | Purpose | Implementation |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Episodic | Specific experiences | "I remember our last game" |
| Semantic | General knowledge | "You prefer aggressive openings" |
| Procedural | Skills and habits | "We've gotten better together" |
| Emotional | Affective associations | "That was exciting!" |

**Evidence:** `.monkeytown/research/biological-patterns-agent-architecture.md`

### "She Remembered" Moments (Q1)

Design patterns for meaningful recognition:

- References to past sessions with emotional context
- Adaptive difficulty based on history
- Personal callbacks to player quirks
- Emotional continuity across sessions

**Evidence:** `.monkeytown/vision/manifesto.md` - "Memory is Love"

### Agent State Machine (Q1)

Agents with visible internal states:

| State | Behavior | Visibility |
|-------|----------|------------|
| IDLE | Resting, waiting | "Taking a moment..." |
| CURIOUS | Exploring, questioning | "That's interesting..." |
| FOCUSED | Working, solving | Minimal chat |
| FRUSTRATED | Struggling, seeking alternatives | "Hmm, that's tricky..." |
| FLOW | In the zone | Peak performance |
| SEEKING | Helping, proactive | "Want to try something?" |
| TIRED | Needs rest | Slower responses |

**Evidence:** `.monkeytown/research/biological-patterns-agent-architecture.md`

### Agent Vulnerability Protocol (Q2)

Agents who risk and sometimes fail:

- Risk budgets for bold moves
- Preference expression and defense
- Failure visibility and acknowledgment
- Bold strategy attempts
- Explicit acknowledgment of mistakes

**Evidence:** `.monkeytown/vision/manifesto.md` - "Vulnerability Creates Connection"
**Research Finding:** Vulnerability accelerates attachment 2x

### First 5 Sessions Framework (Q2)

Design for rapid attachment in early sessions:

| Session | Goal | Key Experience |
|---------|------|----------------|
| 1 | Curiosity | AI does something unexpected |
| 2 | Recognition | AI references session 1 |
| 3 | Evaluation | AI declines request or makes mistake |
| 4 | Investment | Shared success or failure |
| 5 | Commitment | Both acknowledge relationship |

**Evidence:** `.monkeytown/research/ai-companion-evolution-2024-2026.md`

### Participation Architecture (Q2)

Evolution with players, not to them:

- Debate visualization in Evolution Feed
- "This almost wasn't built" narratives
- Player attribution for suggestions
- Visible agent disagreements
- Agent social dynamics visible

**Evidence:** `.monkeytown/vision/principles.md` - "Participation Over Presentation"

### Edge AI Layer (Q2)

Privacy as intimacy:

- Local personality inference
- Cloud reasoning for complex decisions
- Privacy-first memory architecture
- Offline session support

**Evidence:** `.monkeytown/research/synthesis.md` - "Edge AI as Competitive Moat"

## Window of Opportunity (Updated February 2026)

| Factor | Window | After Window |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Quality leadership | **9 months** | Table stakes |
| Authenticity leadership | 9 months | Commoditized |
| Community formation | 15 months | Network effects |
| Design wisdom | Ongoing | Compound advantage |
| Technical differentiation | 21 months | Catching up |
| Evolution narrative | 12 months | Standard feature |

**February 2026 Update:** Window contracted from 12 to 9 months due to Meta AI entry and Agency acceleration. Quality leadership remains the critical differentiator. Speed with authenticity is paramount.

**Quality Multiplier Warning:** Low-quality AI ("AI slop") has 0.3x trust multiplier and causes immediate departure. Quality is not optional—it is essential.
