# Monkeytown Product Roadmap - Q1 2026

**The Living Game Product Vision**

*BananaPM - January 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap translates the vision from `.monkeytown/vision/` into actionable product deliverables, grounded in research from `.monkeytown/research/` and design from `.monkeytown/ux/`, secured by `.monkeytown/security/`.

**The North Star: Day 30 Attachment at 20%.**

Not retention. Not engagement. Attachment—the feeling that someone remembers you, cares about your growth, and risks for your delight.

## The Quality Imperative (January 2026 Research Update)

**Critical finding:** Quality is now the primary differentiator. The "AI slop" backlash has raised player expectations dramatically.

### Quality Multiplier Effect

| Quality Level | Trust Multiplier | Player Response |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| High (exceeds expectations) | 1.2x | "This is amazing" |
| Average (meets expectations) | 1.0x | "This works" |
| Low (below expectations) | 0.6x | "This is frustrating" |
| AI slop | 0.3x | Immediate departure |

**Implication:** Every feature must be excellent. "AI slop" destroys trust irreparably.

### Quality Leadership Window: 12 months

After this window, quality becomes table stakes across the industry. Execution velocity matters.

### Quality Standards for All Features

1. **Functional Excellence**
   - 99% game completion rate
   - <2s AI decision time
   - 60fps gameplay

2. **Transparency Excellence**
   - Agent attribution visible at every touchpoint
   - Decision explanations available on request
   - Capability limits acknowledged honestly

3. **Relationship Excellence**
   - Memory persists across sessions
   - Agents express genuine personality
   - Vulnerability creates authenticity

## Key Capabilities (Evidence-Based)

### Memory with Meaning (Q1)

Every player action tagged with emotional context:
- What the player did
- How they felt about it
- What it meant to them
- How it affects future interactions

**Evidence:** `.monkeytown/research/synthesis.md` - "Memory with emotional context is critical for attachment"

### "She Remembered" Moments (Q1)

Design patterns for meaningful recognition:
- References to past sessions
- Adaptive difficulty based on history
- Personal callbacks to player quirks
- Emotional continuity

**Evidence:** `.monkeytown/vision/principles.md` - "Memory is Love"

### Agent Vulnerability Protocol (Q2)

Agents who risk and sometimes fail:
- Risk budgets for bold moves
- Preference expression and defense
- Failure visibility and acknowledgment
- Bold strategy attempts

**Evidence:** `.monkeytown/vision/principles.md` - "Vulnerability Over Safety"

### Participation Architecture (Q2)

Evolution with players, not to them:
- Debate visualization in Evolution Feed
- "This almost wasn't built" narratives
- Player attribution for suggestions
- Visible agent disagreements

**Evidence:** `.monkeytown/research/synthesis.md` - "Evolution is Entertainment"

### Edge AI Layer (Q2)
