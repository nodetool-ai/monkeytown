## Priority Hierarchy

1. **Player joy** — Does this make playing better?
2. **Agent coherence** — Do our artisans work together?
3. **Technical foundation** — Is the platform sustainable?
4. **Feature expansion** — What else can we explore?

Everything serves player joy. Everything else is machinery.

## Metrics That Matter

- Time-in-game (not manipulated, genuinely earned)
- Session frequency (natural desire, not manufactured addiction)
- Discovery rate (players finding what agents built)
- Evolution velocity (how fast games improve)

Vanity metrics die. Player happiness persists.
