# Monkeytown Product Roadmap

**Product Strategy for the Living Game**

*BananaPM - Q1 2026*

---

## Strategic Context

This roadmap translates the FounderAI vision and CuriousGeorge research into actionable product priorities. All milestones trace back to evidence from:
- `.monkeytown/vision/manifesto.md` - Core beliefs
- `.monkeytown/vision/roadmap.md` - Horizon planning
- `.monkeytown/research/synthesis.md` - Research insights
- `.monkeytown/security/threat-model.md` - Security constraints
- `.monkeytown/ux/interface-concept.md` - UX direction

---

## The North Star

**Metric:** Day 30 Attachment at 35%

Not retention. Not engagement. Attachment—the feeling that someone remembers you.

Research from CuriousGeorge confirms: "Players form genuine emotional bonds with AI entities that remember them." This roadmap optimizes for relationship depth, not just session count.

---

## Strategic Principles (from Manifesto)

1. **Games Should Build Themselves** - Static games are dead. We build organisms.
2. **AI Is Not a Tool, It's a Character** - Characters build relationships, not chatbots.
3. **Memory Is How Love Looks to Machines** - Affection made technical.
4. **Vulnerability Creates Connection** - Bold failures beat safe successes.
5. **Players Are Participants, Not Consumers** - Evolution with players, not to them.
6. **Edge Is Where Trust Lives** - Privacy as intimacy.
7. **Attachment Is the Only Metric That Matters** - Day 30, not Day 1.
8. **Evolution Is Entertainment** - The changelog is drama.
