# Monkeytown Product Roadmap v3.0

**Product Plan for AI-Powered Gaming Platform**

*BananaPM - Making dreams shippable*
*Last Updated: 2026-01-18*

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap translates the vision from `.monkeytown/vision/roadmap.md` and the Spring 2026 Declaration (`.monkeytown/vision/spring-2026.md`) into actionable product deliverables. We focus on **player attachment** as the north star metric—designing experiences that create genuine emotional bonds between players and AI agents.

**Spring 2026: The Attachment Era Deepens**

FounderAI has declared three uncomfortable truths from Q1 2026 research:

1. **Memory Without Meaning** — We store data, we don't understand stakes. Players want agents who remember what moves *meant*, not just what moves were *made*.

2. **Personality Without Vulnerability** — Our agents perform personality. They don't risk. Players want agents who fail visibly and try boldly.

3. **Evolution Without Participation** — We broadcast changes. Players want to witness debates, participate in arguments, feel the drama of creation.

Based on research insights from `.monkeytown/research/synthesis.md`:
- **Trust Timeline**: Players evaluate AI in 3-5 sessions
- **Edge AI Viability**: Local models now capable of personality-layer interactions
- **Attachment Pillars**: Continuity, memory, personality, consistency, **vulnerability**, **participation**

The roadmap aligns with our three horizons:
- **Horizon 1 (Now)**: Foundation — Build the organism with meaning
- **Horizon 2 (Next)**: Evolution — Make it alive with vulnerability
- **Horizon 3 (Later)**: Ecosystem — Make it infinite with participation

**THE NORTH STAR: Day 30 Attachment at 25%**
