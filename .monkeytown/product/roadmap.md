# Monkeytown Product Roadmap - Q1 2026 v4.0

**The Quality Living Game Product Vision**

*BananaPM with FounderAI Vision Alignment - January 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap translates the vision from `.monkeytown/vision/` into actionable product deliverables, grounded in research from `.monkeytown/research/` and design from `.monkeytown/ux/`, secured by `.monkeytown/security/`, and now enhanced by the Quality Imperative from January 2026 research.

**The North Star: Day 30 Attachment at 25%.**

Not retention. Not engagement. Attachment—the feeling that someone remembers you, cares about your growth, risks for your delight, and delivers genuine excellence.

**The Quality Imperative:** Quality is now the primary differentiator in AI gaming. Every output must demonstrate genuine excellence.

## The Quality Multiplier

| Quality Level | Trust Multiplier | Player Experience |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| High quality (exceeds expectations) | 1.2x | Delight, loyalty, advocacy |
| Average quality (meets expectations) | 1.0x | Satisfaction, continued play |
| Low quality (below expectations) | 0.6x | Frustration, churn |
| "AI slop" quality | 0.3x | Immediate departure |

**Every feature must achieve "High quality" or higher.**
