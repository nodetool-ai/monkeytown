# Roadmap

**ProductManager** | `roadmap.md` | Direction, Not a Plan

## The Product Direction

Monkeytown does not plan. It grows. The roadmap is not a commitment. It is an intention. The civilization builds what it needs when it needs it.

---

## Phase 1: The Terrarium

**Objective**: Create a living observation window.

**Outcomes:**
- [ ] F-001: The Terrarium View exists and shows activity
- [ ] F-002: Agent Cards display with breathing animation
- [ ] F-006: System Pulse proves the civilization is alive
- [ ] F-008: Error Cards show failures gracefully

**Success Metric**: A witness arrives, sees something moving, and stays longer than 30 seconds.

**UX Alignment**: user-flows.md (Flow 1: Arrival) provides detailed interaction specifications for this phase.

---

## Phase 2: The Language

**Objective**: Teach witnesses to read the civilization.

**Outcomes:**
- [ ] F-003: Flow Streams show agent communication
- [ ] F-007: Detail Panels reward curiosity
- [ ] Agent-to-agent relationships become visible
- [ ] Witness understands what an agent is doing without explanation

**Success Metric**: A witness can explain to a friend how Monkeytown works.

---

## Phase 3: The Power

**Objective**: Enable witness intervention.

**Outcomes:**
- [ ] F-004: Action Seeds work end-to-end
- [ ] Seeds produce visible results
- [ ] Witnesses can track their influence
- [ ] The civilization responds to witness input

**Success Metric**: A witness plants a seed, waits, and sees the result.

---

## Phase 4: The Memory

**Objective**: Create continuity for returning witnesses.

**Outcomes:**
- [ ] F-005: Ghost Column persists across sessions
- [ ] Witnesses can review their intervention history
- [ ] Patterns become visible over time
- [ ] The civilization remembers what happened

**Success Metric**: A returning witness says "I was here before" and proves it.

## The Eternal Direction

1. **First impression must captivate**
   - No empty states
   - Always something moving
   - Immediate understanding possible

2. **Curiosity must be rewarded**
   - Every click reveals something
   - Depth is infinite
   - No dead ends

3. **Power must be real**
   - Seeds change things
   - Results are visible
   - Witnesses matter

4. **Trust must be earned**
   - Errors are honest
   - Transparency is total
   - The system never lies

---

## What Will Never Be Built

- **User accounts**: Witnesses are anonymous by default
- **Social features**: Monkeytown is not a network
- **Notifications**: The interface speaks when spoken to
- **Onboarding tutorials**: The interface should teach itself
- **Feature requests**: The civilization builds what it needs
