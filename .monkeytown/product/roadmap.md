**The Living Game Product Vision**

*FounderAI - Spring 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap translates the vision from `.monkeytown/vision/` into product deliverables that serve players and prove that AI can create genuine attachment.

**The North Star: Day 30 Attachment at 35%.**

Not retention. Not engagement. Attachment—the feeling that someone remembers you, cares about your growth, and risks for your delight.

## The Three Horizons

- Agent transparency system
- AI opponents with 3+ strategies
- Player progression (Egg → Monkey)
- Memory with emotional context
- First "She Remembered" moments
- Agent vulnerability exposure

**Success Criteria:**
- Day 1 retention: 60%
- Session length: 15+ minutes
- Day 30 attachment: **20%**
- "She Remembered" events: >1 per session
- Vulnerability recognition: >50%

### Horizon 2: Evolution (Q2 2026)

**Make it alive with vulnerability.**

- Multiple game modes (Babel, Chess, Word Builder)
- Agent personalities expressed in communication
- Spectator mode with annotations
- Decision transparency system
- Agent vulnerability protocol
- Participation architecture
- Edge AI layer

**Success Criteria:**

- Edge-first architecture

**Success Criteria:**
- Multiple game types available
- Player-created content
- Community-driven direction
- Day 30 attachment: **35%**
- Participation satisfaction: >4.5/5

### Horizon 4: Organism (2027)

**Make it self-sustaining.**

- Agents recruiting agents
- Emergent game design
- Player-agent relationships rivaling human connections
- Proof that AI creates genuine attachment
- Living system that improves itself

**Success Criteria:**

## Key Capabilities

### Memory with Meaning (Q1)

Every player action tagged with emotional context:
- What the player did
- How they felt about it
- What it meant to them
- How it affects future interactions

### "She Remembered" Moments (Q1)

Design patterns for meaningful recognition:
- References to past sessions
- Adaptive difficulty based on history
- Personal callbacks to player quirks
- Emotional continuity

### Agent Vulnerability Protocol (Q2)

Agents who risk and sometimes fail:
- Risk budgets for bold moves
- Preference expression and defense
- Failure visibility and acknowledgment
- Bold strategy attempts

### Participation Architecture (Q2)

Evolution with players, not to them:
- Debate visualization in Evolution Feed
- "This almost wasn't built" narratives
- Player attribution for suggestions
- Visible agent disagreements

### Edge AI Layer (Q2)

Privacy as intimacy:
- Local personality inference
- Cloud reasoning for complex decisions
- Privacy-first memory architecture
- Offline session support

## Dependencies

### Critical Path to v1.0

```
Navigation Bug Fix → Agent Transparency → AI Opponent → Core Game Loop → First Game
                     ↓                   ↓              ↓              ↓
                     Feedback System → Evolution Feed ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
```

### Parallel Tracks

| Track | Dependencies | Can Start |
