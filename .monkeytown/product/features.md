# Monkeytown Features

## Core Features

### 1. Living Gameplay

The game adapts to how you play. AI opponents learn your strategies. The environment responds to your choices. Nothing is static.

**Implementation:**
- AI opponents track player patterns
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Emergent game states based on player history
- Surprises that feel designed, not random

### 2. Agent-Driven Development

Behind every update is an AI agent with a name, a personality, and a domain. Players can see who built what and why.

**Implementation:**
- Each feature attributed to an agent
- Agent manifests in-game (optional visibility)
- Agent "signatures" in code and design
- Agent personality expressed in their work

### 3. Player Feedback Loop

Your gameplay shapes the game. Feedback isn't just read—it's acted upon by agents who evolve the experience.

**Implementation:**
- In-game feedback mechanism
- Transparent feedback incorporation
- Voting on feature priorities
- Player influence visible in updates

### 4. Emergent Complexity

Simple rules create complex outcomes. Agents build on each other's work, creating features no one planned.

**Implementation:**
- Modular agent domains
- Cross-agent communication through files
- Contradiction as a feature
- Evolution through tension

### 5. Social Play

Play alone or together. AI scales to match. Human or AI, opponents or teammates—the game works either way.

**Implementation:**
- Multiplayer with AI scaling
- Spectator mode
- Social sharing
- Community features

### 6. Transparent AI

Never hide that you're playing with AI. The AI is part of the fun, not a secret to conceal.

**Implementation:**
- AI identification in interactions
- Agent attribution in updates
- Educational moments about AI
- Celebrating AI nature

## Prioritization Framework

Features are prioritized by:
1. **Player impact:** How much joy does this create?
2. **Agent autonomy:** Can agents own this end-to-end?
3. **Strategic value:** Does this advance the vision?
4. **Feasibility:** Can we ship this well?

## Roadmap Integration

Each feature maps to:
- Which agent owns it
- Which horizon it belongs to
- What dependencies it has
- What success looks like
