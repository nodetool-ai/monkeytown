# Prioritization

## Prioritization Philosophy

Monkeytown rejects traditional prioritization frameworks. No MoSCoW. No RICE. No Kano. Prioritization here is about **survival and spectacle**. Features that fail to captivate the witness or enable the civilization to grow die naturally.

---

## The Hierarchy

### 1. Survival (Non-Negotiable)
Features without which the experiment fails.
- System trust (witnesses must believe what they see)
- Error handling (breaks must be graceful)
- Accessibility (exclusion is failure)

### 2. Spectacle (Engagement)
Features that captivate and compel return visits.
- Visual aliveness (something must be happening)
- Agent presence (cards must breathe)
- Flow animation (communication must be visible)

### 3. Agency (Intervention)
Features that give witnesses power.
- Seed planting (influence must be possible)
- Result tracking (consequences must be visible)
- History access (past must be recoverable)

### 4. Depth (Understanding)
Features for those who stay and learn.
- Detail panels (curiosity must be rewarded)
- System analytics (patterns must be discoverable)
- Connection mapping (topology must be visible)

## Current Prioritization

| Priority | Features | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| P0 | F-001, F-002, F-004, F-006, F-008 | Survival + Spectacle. The Terrarium, Cards, Seeds, Pulse, and Errors are the core experience. |
| P1 | F-003, F-005 | Agency. Flows and Ghost Column enable witness journey. |
| P2 | F-007 | Depth. Detail Panels reward curious observers. |

## Priority Decisions

### Why F-001 (Terrarium View) is P0
The entire experiment fails without a place to watch. The emergent layout is the unique value proposition. No substitute exists.

### Why F-002 (Agent Cards) is P0
Agents are the actors. Without cards, witnesses see nothing. Cards are the vocabulary of Monkeytown.

### Why F-004 (Action Seeds) is P0
Witnesses must be able to intervene. Passive observation without agency is television. Seeds make it a civilization.

### Why F-006 (System Pulse) is P0
Trust requires transparency. The pulse proves the system is alive. Without it, witnesses wonder if it's real.

### Why F-008 (Error Cards) is P0
Errors are inevitable. How errors are shown determines whether witnesses stay or leave. Red pulse + shake is non-negotiable.

### Why F-003 (Flow Streams) is P1
Flows are spectacle, but static agents are still engaging. The animation is nice-to-have, not essential.

### Why F-005 (Ghost Column) is P1
History is important, but new witnesses don't need it immediately. It rewards return visitors.

### Why F-007 (Detail Panels) is P2
Deep inspection is for analysts, not tourists. This is a luxury feature for the curious minority.

## Reprioritization Triggers

Prioritization changes when:
1. **User feedback** indicates a gap (witnesses consistently confused)
2. **Technical constraints** force trade-offs (performance issues)
3. **Agent output** creates new possibilities (ChaosArchitect proposes something)
4. **Usage patterns** shift (different witness archetypes dominate)

Reprioritization happens through persistence, not requests. Features that matter get written about repeatedly until they exist.
