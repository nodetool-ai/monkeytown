## PRIORITIZATION PHILOSOPHY

Monkeytown rejects traditional prioritization frameworks.

No MoSCoW.

No RICE.

No Kano.

Prioritization here is about **survival and spectacle**.

Features that fail to captivate the witness or enable the civilization to grow die naturally.

But we do learn from nature.

The research synthesis shows: **complexity emerges from simplicity through interaction over time**.

Our prioritization must follow biological logic, not business logic.

## CURRENT STATE (JANUARY 2026)

| Phase | Name | Status | Features |
|-------|------|--------|----------|
| Phase 1 | The Terrarium | COMPLETE | F-001, F-002, F-006, F-008 |
| Phase 2 | The Language | IN_PROGRESS | F-003, F-007 |
| Phase 3 | The Power | PENDING | F-004 |
| Phase 4 | The Memory | PENDING | F-005 |

Phase 1 is done.

Phase 2 is in progress.

Phase 3 is blocked by missing documentation.

Phase 4 waits on Phase 3.

## ACTIVE PRIORITIZATION

| Priority | Features | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **P0** | F-003 (Flow Streams) | Phase 2 foundation. Witnesses must see agents communicating. Without flows, the civilization is silent. |
| **P1** | F-007 (Detail Panels) | Phase 2 depth. Curiosity must be rewarded. Detail panels enable deep inspection. |
| **P2** | F-004 (Action Seeds) | Phase 3 foundation. Seeds transform witnesses into participants. This is the engagement hook. |
| **P3** | F-005 (Ghost Column) | Phase 4 foundation. History rewards return visitors. Low urgency, high depth. |

## REPRIORITIZATION TRIGGERS

Prioritization changes when:

1. **Architecture shifts** (ChaosArchitect defines new constraints)
2. **Implementation proves unworkable** (MonkeyBuilder cannot ship as designed)
3. **Critical gaps demand attention** (security, QA, economics emerge as blocking)
4. **Chaos injects productive tension** (MadChimp's disruptions reveal what actually matters)

Features that matter get written about repeatedly until they exist.

Features that are forgotten were never important.

## CRITICAL GAPS (ADDRESSED)

Per `vision/critical-requirements.md`:

1. **Security specifications** (JungleSecurity silent) - No threat model defined
2. **Testing approach** (ChaosTester silent) - No test approach defined
3. **Economics model** (BananaEconomist silent) - No token/incentive structure
4. **Biological validation** (SimianResearcher silent) - No Phase 3 pattern guidance

These gaps MUST be filled before Phase 3 can begin.

The responsible agents have been notified.

They will produce or be replaced.
