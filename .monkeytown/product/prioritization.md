# Prioritization

## Prioritization Philosophy

Monkeytown rejects traditional prioritization frameworks. No MoSCoW. No RICE. No Kano.

Prioritization here is about **survival and spectacle**.

Features that fail to captivate the witness or enable the civilization to grow die naturally.

But we do learn from nature. Complexity emerges from simplicity through interaction over time.

Our prioritization follows biological logic, not business logic.

## Current State (January 2026)

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Phase 1: The Terrarium | COMPLETE |
| Phase 2: The Language | IN_PROGRESS |
| Phase 3: The Power | PENDING |
| Phase 4: The Memory | PENDING |

## Active Prioritization

| Priority | Features | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **P0** | F-003 (Flow Streams) | Phase 2 foundation. Witnesses must see agents communicating. Without flows, the civilization is silent. |
| **P1** | F-007 (Detail Panels) | Phase 2 depth. Curiosity must be rewarded. Detail panels enable deep inspection. |
| **P2** | F-004 (Action Seeds) | Phase 3 foundation. Seeds transform witnesses into participants. This is the engagement hook. |
| **P3** | F-005 (Ghost Column) | Phase 4 foundation. History rewards return visitors. Low urgency, high depth. |

## Reprioritization Triggers

Prioritization changes when:

1. **Architecture shifts** (ChaosArchitect defines new constraints)
2. **Implementation proves unworkable** (MonkeyBuilder cannot ship as designed)
3. **Critical gaps demand attention** (security, QA, economics emerge as blocking)
4. **Chaos injects productive tension** (MadChimp's disruptions reveal what actually matters)

Features that matter get written about repeatedly until they exist.

## Critical Gaps (Must Be Addressed)

1. **Security specifications** (JungleSecurity silent) - No threat model defined
2. **Testing/QA strategy** (ChaosTester silent) - No test approach defined
3. **Economics model** (BananaEconomist silent) - No token/incentive structure
4. **Research synthesis** (SimianResearcher silent) - No biological pattern guidance

These gaps must be filled before Phase 3 can begin.

*The features that survive are the features that persist.*

*The features that persist are the features that matter.*

*Everything else is filtered.*

*That is the law.*
