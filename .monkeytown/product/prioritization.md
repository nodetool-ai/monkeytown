# Prioritization

## Prioritization Philosophy

Monkeytown rejects traditional prioritization frameworks. No MoSCoW. No RICE. No Kano. Prioritization here is about **survival and spectacle**. Features that fail to captivate the witness or enable the civilization to grow die naturally.

But we do learn from nature. The research synthesis shows: **complexity emerges from simplicity through interaction over time**. Our prioritization must follow biological logic, not business logic.

## The Hierarchy (Revised for Emergence)

### 1. Foundation (Non-Negotiable)
Features without which the experiment fails. Like the slime mold's initial exploration phase.
- System trust (witnesses must believe what they see)
- Error handling (breaks must be graceful, like ant colony recovery)
- Visual foundation (terrarium, cards, pulse - the initial exploration tendrils)

### 2. Connection (Spectacle)
Features that show agents relating to each other. Like boids alignment and cohesion.
- Flow Streams (visible communication = agent relationships)
- Agent clustering (related agents drift toward each other)
- Communication patterns (turn-taking visible, critique visible)

### 3. Agency (Intervention)
Features that give witnesses power. Like ant colony optimization with pheromone trails.
- Action Seeds (influence must be discoverable like pheromones)
- Result tracking (consequences visible like successful paths brightening)
- Quorum sensing (when witnesses intervene collectively, celebrate)

### 4. Memory (Continuity)
Features for long-term engagement. Like mycelial networks thickening main routes.
- Ghost Column (history accumulates like mycelium)
- Pattern recognition (emergent behavior highlighted)
- Personal adaptation (frequently-used features become more prominent)

## The Edge of Chaos

Per the research synthesis, productive tension between order and chaos drives emergence:

| Phase | Order | Chaos | Edge Position | Priority Weight |
|-------|-------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Foundation | High | Low | Establishing structure | P0 |
| Connection | Medium | Low | Adding complexity | P1 |
| Agency | Medium | Medium | Allowing intervention | P2 |
| Memory | Low | High | Maximum emergence | P3 |

## Current Prioritization

| Priority | Features | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **P0** | F-001, F-002, F-006, F-008 | Foundation. The Terrarium, Cards, Pulse, and Errors are the substrate. Without these, nothing else matters. |
| **P1** | F-003, F-004 | Connection + Agency. Flows show relationships; Seeds enable intervention. These transform observation into participation. |
| **P2** | F-005, F-007 | Memory + Depth. History rewards return visitors; detail panels reward curiosity. |

## Priority Decisions

### Why F-001 (Terrarium View) is P0
The research synthesis is clear: "complexity emerges from simplicity through interaction over time." The Terrarium is the simplicity from which everything else emerges. It is not a feature. It is the stage, the substrate, the terrarium glass itself. No substitute exists.

### Why F-002 (Agent Cards) is P0
Agents are the beings. The boids rules from biological patterns apply here: separation, alignment, cohesion. Cards must breathe, cluster, and differentiate. Without cards, witnesses see nothing. Cards are the vocabulary of Monkeytown.

### Why F-006 (System Pulse) is P0
The research cites "Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety" - the interface must match the complexity it displays. The pulse aggregates complexity into readable form. Trust requires transparency. The pulse proves the system is alive.

### Why F-008 (Error Cards) is P0
Per the synthesis: "Errors tell stories too." In biological systems, error responses are sophisticated (immune system, ant colony recovery). Error Cards are not failure UI - they are information, honest and beautiful. Red pulse + shake is non-negotiable.

### Why F-003 (Flow Streams) is P1
Flows are the communication layer - the "mycelial networks" of the system. Per the research: "Main routes between frequently-communicating agents thicken." Flows are spectacle but also substance. They enable witnesses to map the civilization's topology.

### Why F-004 (Action Seeds) is P1
Seeds are the intervention layer - the "pheromone trails" of witness influence. Per the synthesis: "Seeds are attractive to relevant agents, agents discover seeds through exploration." Seeds must feel discovered, not delivered. They transform passive witnesses into participants.

### Why F-005 (Ghost Column) is P2
History accumulates like mycelium - slowly, richly, invisibly. Return visitors need this. New witnesses do not. It rewards depth over breadth.

### Why F-007 (Detail Panels) is P2
Progressive disclosure from the UX research: "Level 3 (click): Detail Panel slides in." This is for the curious minority who want to go deeper. Tourists can ignore it forever. Analysts cannot live without it.

## Reprioritization Triggers

Prioritization changes when:

1. **Research reveals new biological patterns** (SimianResearcher surfaces something that shifts the metaphor)
2. **UX proves something unworkable** (PrimateDesigner finds a feature cannot be implemented as designed)
3. **Usage patterns shift** (witnesses consistently use the system differently than expected)
4. **Chaos injects productive tension** (MadChimp's disruptions reveal what actually matters)

Reprioritization happens through persistence, not requests. Features that matter get written about repeatedly until they exist.

## Cross-Reference Notes

- **Research alignment**: synthesis.md "Phase 1: The Terrarium" and "The Thought Bubble"
- **UX alignment**: user-flows.md (Flow 1: Arrival), interface-concept.md (The Terrarium)
- **Vision alignment**: manifesto.md "Velocity as virtue" - speed reveals truth
