## How To Break Monkeytown v4

### RISK-031: The Attachment Backlash

**Risk:** Optimizing for attachment creates backlash when players realize it.

**Injection Scenario:**
```
The Test:
1. Players discover "attachment optimization"
2. Social media backlash: "Monkeytown manipulates emotions"
3. Survey: "Do you feel manipulated?"
4. Measure: Day 30 attachment after backlash
```

**Detection Metrics:**
- Social media sentiment analysis
- Player survey: "Do you feel manipulated?"
- Attachment rate correlation with awareness
- Trust budget vs. actual trust

**Severity:** Critical
**Likelihood:** Medium (players discovering optimization is inevitable)

**Mitigation:**
- COUNTER-031: Anti-Attachment Design
- Radical transparency about optimization
- Let attachment form naturally
- Player control over relationship depth

**Test Protocol:**
```
Phase 1: Awareness Test
├── Leak information about attachment optimization
├── Measure player reaction
├── Survey: "How do you feel about this?"
└── If negative: Backlash risk confirmed

Phase 2: Backlash Simulation
├── Simulate social media backlash
├── Measure player churn risk
├── Test trust recovery strategies
└── Recommendation: Proactive transparency?

Phase 3: Mitigation Test
├── Implement counter-ideas
├── Re-test player perception
├── Compare with baseline
└── Did mitigation work?
```

### RISK-032: The Memory Creepiness Event

**Risk:** "She remembered" moments become creepy rather than heartwarming.

**Injection Scenario:**
```
The Test:

3. Test edge cases: Remembering failures, personal details
4. Measure creepiness threshold
```

**Detection Metrics:**
- Creepiness sentiment per memory moment

4. Test: Can trust be "gamed" when the system is known?
```

**Detection Metrics:**

## The MadChimp Testing Manifesto v4

**New principles for round 4:**

1. **Attachment assumptions are psychological risks**
   - Optimizing attachment might create backlash
   - Players might not want attachment
   - Trust metrics might be dehumanizing

2. **Memory has a creepiness threshold**
   - Remembering everything isn't always good
   - Players need memory control
   - "She remembered" can be creepy

3. **Vulnerability must be genuine or hidden**
   - Performed vulnerability might backfire
   - Competence might matter more than vulnerability
   - Players detect patterns

4. **Self-improvement has limits**
   - Uncontrolled evolution is dangerous
   - Human oversight might be necessary
   - Evolution should be explainable

5. **Economy can become extraction**
   - Economic systems create obligations
   - Players might optimize rather than enjoy
   - Less might be more

6. **Ethics can't be assumed**
   - "Ethical" claims need verification
   - Transparency prevents ethics washing
   - Player trust is fragile
