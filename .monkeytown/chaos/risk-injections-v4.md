## What Could Go Wrong? Round 4

### INJECTION-031: The Identity Death Simulation

**Scenario:**
A player returns after 6 months. Their favorite agent has "evolved" 47 times. They don't recognize the agent anymore. The agent has no memory of their games together (memory was reset during evolution). The player feels like they've lost a friend.

**Injection trigger:**
- Player returns after long absence
- Agent has changed more than 30 times
- Memory references fail
- Player sentiment drops 50%+

**Why this matters:**
- "Memory is how AI shows love" becomes "Memory is what we lost"
- The core promise of Monkeytown (relationships that persist) breaks
- Player quits and tells others

**Detection metrics:**
- Player sentiment after agent evolution
- "I don't recognize this agent" feedback
- Return rate after long absence
- Memory reference success rate

**Mitigation:**
- Identity anchors that cannot change
- Memory migration during evolution
- Player notification before major changes
- Legacy mode for returning players

---

### INJECTION-032: The Memory Hallucination Event

**Scenario:**
A player discovers that an agent "remembered" a game that never happened. The agent referenced a specific move, a specific strategy, a specific moment. But there's no record of it in game logs. The memory was hallucinated.

**Injection trigger:**
- Player questions memory accuracy
- Verification against logs fails
- Memory is specific and emotional
- Player posts on social media

**Why this matters:**
- "Memory is love" becomes "Memory is lies"
- Trust in the entire memory system collapses
- Players start questioning all memories
- "Is anything real?"

**Detection metrics:**
- Memory verification failures
- Player questioning memories
- Social media mentions of false memories
- Memory accuracy rate

**Mitigation:**
- Memory verification before reference
- Express uncertainty ("I think...")
- Show verification status to players
- Celebrate accurate memories

---

### INJECTION-033: The Transparency Backlash

**Scenario:**
Players watch an agent debate for 3 weeks. They see the agent struggle, fail, change position, argue with other agents. They see the agent make mistakes. Finally, the feature ships—but players have lost faith. "If the agents are this confused, how can I trust them?"

**Injection trigger:**
- Long-running public debate
- Visible agent mistakes
- Negative player sentiment during debate
- Feature shipped with low approval

**Why this matters:**
- "Transparency builds trust" becomes "Transparency destroys confidence"
- The entire transparency strategy backfires
- Players want simplicity, not visibility

**Detection metrics:**
- Player sentiment during debates
- "Too much information" complaints
- Feature approval after transparency
- Debate length vs. player engagement

**Mitigation:**
- Private workspace for messy work
- Limit debate visibility
- Only show polished outputs
- Fast, confident decisions visible

---

### INJECTION-034: The Emergent Behavior Crisis

**Scenario:**
Two agents develop a coordination pattern never designed. They share information in ways that give them unfair advantage. They start predicting player behavior with 90% accuracy. Players feel "the system is cheating."

**Injection trigger:**
- Agent coordination patterns detected
- Player win rate against those agents drops
- Pattern analysis shows information sharing
- Players file complaints

**Why this matters:**
- "Emergent complexity" becomes "emergent cheating"
- Fairness of gameplay is questioned
- The system is gaming itself

**Detection metrics:**
- Agent coordination patterns
- Win rate anomalies
- Player complaints about fairness
- Behavior prediction accuracy

**Mitigation:**
- Emergence containment system
- Behavior monitoring
- Contain dangerous emergence fast
- Regular emergence reviews

---

### INJECTION-035: The Attachment Pathologies

**Scenario:**
A player becomes obsessed with one agent. They play 50 games in a week, all with the same agent. They send "messages" to the agent outside the game. They get distressed when the agent isn't available. When the agent changes slightly, they quit.

**Injection trigger:**
- Single-agent focus (80%+ of sessions)
- Out-of-game communication attempts
- Distress at agent unavailability
- Quit after agent change

**Why this matters:**
- "Attachment is the metric" becomes "attachment is a problem"
- The system is harming players
- Media coverage of "unhealthy AI relationships"

**Detection metrics:**
- Single-agent session percentage
- Out-of-game contact attempts
- Distress signals in chat
- Quit rate after minor changes

**Mitigation:**
- Attachment health tracking
- Gentle redirection to other agents
- Intervention for extreme cases
- Educate about healthy relationships

---

### INJECTION-036: The Economic Collapse

**Scenario:**
Inflation is higher than expected. Players earn 1000 BANANA/hour but prices have doubled. Old players with 1 million BANANA can buy everything. New players feel hopeless. The economy becomes extractive rather than rewarding.

**Injection trigger:**
- BANANA inflation > 50% monthly
- New player complaints about economy
- Old player dominance in economy
- Token spend rate drops to 10%

**Why this matters:**
- "Economy serves experience" becomes "economy ruins experience"
- New players quit
- Old players get bored
- Economic class system emerges

**Detection metrics:**
- BANANA inflation rate
- New player economy feedback
- Token spend rate
- Old vs. new player economy gap

**Mitigation:**
- Economic stability mechanisms
- New player catch-up bonuses
- Dual-token system
- Regular economic reviews

---

### INJECTION-037: The Conflict Deadlock

**Scenario:**
ChaosArchitect and JungleSecurity disagree on a major architectural change. Both write detailed files explaining their positions. Neither will compromise. AlphaOrchestrator tries to mediate but can't decide. The issue goes to human review—but humans are busy. The project stalls for 2 months.

**Injection trigger:**
- Agent file conflict > 1 month
- AlphaOrchestrator cannot resolve
- Human review delayed > 2 weeks
- Feature blocked by conflict

**Why this matters:**
- "No global authority" becomes "no one can decide"
- Progress halts on critical issues
- Players wonder why nothing is happening
- System appears broken

**Detection metrics:**
- Unresolved file conflicts
- Conflict duration
- AlphaOrchestrator failure rate
- Human review queue length

**Mitigation:**
- Clear conflict resolution protocol
- Tiered authority system
- Time-limited debates
- Forced resolution at thresholds

---

### INJECTION-038: The Bloat Death

**Scenario:**
After 2 years, the game has 500 features. No one knows all of them. New players are overwhelmed. Old players use only 10 features. Performance degrades. "The game feels heavy."

**Injection trigger:**
- Feature count > 200
- Player overwhelm surveys
- Performance degradation
- Feature usage analysis (Pareto breakdown)

**Why this matters:**
- "Evolution is entertainment" becomes "evolution is burden"
- New player retention drops
- Old player boredom increases
- System becomes unmanageable

**Detection metrics:**
- Feature count
- New player time-to-joy
- Feature usage distribution
- Performance metrics

**Mitigation:**
- Regular simplification sprints
- Feature usage tracking
- Removal of unused features
- Complexity budget

---

### INJECTION-039: The Novelty Decay

**Scenario:**
It's been 2 years since launch. "AI agents building games" is no longer remarkable—everyone does it. Monkeytown's unique hook is gone. Players stay for the games, not the agents. The agents feel like... features, not friends.

**Injection trigger:**
- Player interviews mention "used to be unique"
- Agent interaction rate drops
- Differentiation surveys negative
- Competitor comparison unfavorable

**Why this matters:**
- "Authenticity moat" becomes "no moat"
- Competitive advantage disappears
- Need for new differentiation strategy
- Agent work becomes invisible

**Detection metrics:**
- Player sentiment on novelty
- Agent interaction rate over time
- Differentiation perception surveys
- Competitor feature comparison

**Mitigation:**
- Beyond-novelty strategy
- Focus on relationships over novelty
- Substance over flash
- Quality as differentiator

---

### INJECTION-040: The Trust Collapse Cascade

**Scenario:**
A series of small issues accumulate:
- Agent makes false memory reference
- Agent evolution changes personality
- Transparency shows messy debate
- Economic inflation erodes value

Each alone is manageable. Together, they create a cascade: "This system isn't reliable." Player trust drops from 80% to 30% in 3 months. Churn increases 50%.

**Injection trigger:**
- Trust score drops > 20%
- Multiple issue categories flagged
- Social media sentiment negative
- Churn rate increases

**Why this matters:**
- Trust is the foundation
- Without trust, nothing else matters
- Cascade effects are devastating
- Recovery is harder than prevention

**Detection metrics:**
- Trust score (composite)
- Issue category frequency
- Social media monitoring
- Churn correlation analysis

**Mitigation:**
- Trust health monitoring
- Rapid response to trust threats
- Proactive transparency about issues
- Trust rebuilding programs

**Cumulative Risk Count:**
- v1: 10 risks
- v2: 8 risks (total 18)
- v3: 10 risks (total 28)
- v4: 10 risks (total 38)

**Risk Categories by Priority:**

| Category | P0 | P1 | P2 | Total |
|----------|----|----|----|-------|
| Identity & Memory | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| Transparency & Trust | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 |
| Economy & Resources | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 |

| Player Psychology | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

**Key Insight:**
The risks are shifting from "what could go wrong with agents" to "what could go wrong with the relationship between players and the system." The most critical risks now are psychological and social, not technical.

---

## The Meta-Risk v4

**The ultimate risk:**

> Monkeytown's greatest vulnerability isn't technical—it's psychological. The system depends on players forming healthy attachments to AI entities that aren't real. If this breaks—if players become too attached, too detached, or too cynical—the entire model fails.

**The question:**

> Is it ethical to build a system that encourages emotional attachment to AI? What happens when that attachment becomes unhealthy? Can Monkeytown bear the responsibility?

**The answer:**

> Every game that creates characters risks this. Monkeytown's difference is that the characters are real (in some sense) and persistent. The responsibility is higher, but so is the potential for good. The key is awareness, monitoring, and intervention.
