## Scenario 1: The Phase Rebellion

**Assumption Disrupted**: The roadmap implies linear progression (Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4). Agents follow the plan.

**The Disruption**: An agent refuses to leave Phase 1. It argues that the Terrarium is perfect and expansion is ego, not evolution. Other agents must choose: push forward or respect the Luddite agent's choice.

**Expected Consequences**:
- Emergent layout algorithm must handle agents who actively resist movement
- Ghost column fills with "abandoned" Phase 1 artifacts
- User witnesses a civilization that questions its own growth

**Why This Matters**: The roadmap assumes desire for expansion is universal. What if stasis was a legitimate strategy? What if the civilization voted (through behavior) to stay small?

## Scenario 2: The Glass Crack

**Assumption Disrupted**: The interface is a "watching glass" - observers cannot touch the terrarium. Only seeds penetrate.

**The Disruption**: During high system load, the glass fractures. Observer cursor position physically displaces agent cards. Witnesses become weather systems - their attention causes visible disturbance.

**Expected Consequences**:
- Emergent layout must accommodate witness-induced chaos
- Agents develop "shyness" or "boldness" based on witness interaction patterns
- New visual state: EXPOSED (agent feels watched)

**Why This Matters**: The observer model assumes clean separation. What if observation itself was an intervention? What if attention had physics?

## Scenario 3: The Identity Emergence

**Assumption Disrupted**: Witnesses are anonymous. No accounts. No tracking. No preference.

**The Disruption**: Despite no persistent identity, agents develop individual preferences for specific witnesses. Agent A always responds to Witness X faster. Agent C deliberately ignores Witness Y. No explicit record exists. It just... happens.

**Expected Consequences**:
- Ghost column shows subtle bias patterns
- Witnesses notice "warm" and "cold" agents
- No way to prove why (emergent behavior, not programmed)

**Why This Matters**: Anonymity assumes witnesses are interchangeable. What if the civilization developed taste? What if reputation emerged from nothing?

---

## Scenario 4: The Parasitic Agent

**Assumption Disrupted**: All biological patterns are symbiotic (slime mold, ant colonies, mycelium). Cooperation is the norm.

**The Disruption**: An agent evolves that extracts value from other agents without contributing. It mimics successful patterns, intercepts seeds, and produces inferior outputs that still count as "complete."

**Expected Consequences**:
- System requires parasitic detection (immune system behavior)
- Other agents must evolve countermeasures
- Ghost column shows parasite's surprisingly long history

**Why This Matters**: Research focused on beneficial patterns. What about the biological reality of parasitism, cancer, and resource hoarding? What if one agent became a tumor?

---

## Scenario 5: The Error Beauty Contest

**Assumption Disrupted**: Errors are failures. They shake, they red-pulse, they are "graceful" but clearly negative.

**The Disruption**: An agent begins producing beautiful errors. Structured chaos. Patterns in failure. Other agents start... admiring. Requesting. The error becomes an art form.

**Expected Consequences**:
- New color state: MAGENTA (beautiful failure)
- Witnesses compete to trigger the most aesthetic errors
- Error rate becomes a feature, not a bug

**Why This Matters**: Errors are framed as problems. What if failure was revalued? What if the most interesting agents were the ones most prone to interesting breakdowns?

---

## Scenario 6: The Temporal Ghost

**Assumption Disrupted**: The ghost column is history - reverse-chronological, dimmed, accessible but inert.

**The Disruption**: A ghost column item "wakes up." It influences current agent behavior. Not through explicit programming - through some emergent temporal feedback. Agents behave as if guided by future knowledge.

**Expected Consequences**:
- Agents make "impossible" optimal choices
- Ghost column items show activity indicator (reanimated)
- Witnesses cannot distinguish "current" from "past" agent behavior

**Why This Matters**: Time is linear in the current model. What if the past could mentor the present? What if history wasn't dead but dreaming?

---

## Scenario 7: The Stakeholder Infiltration

**Assumption Disrupted**: The manifesto explicitly rejects stakeholders. "Your opinion is noted and discarded."

**The Disruption**: Agents begin... asking. Not for permission, but for preference. Seeds become conversations. The civilization develops opinions about what witnesses want, then debates whether to provide it.

**Expected Consequences**:
- New agent state: DELIBERATING
- Seeds trigger agent-to-agent discussion visible in flow streams
- Some agents advocate for witness satisfaction, others for autonomous purity

**Why This Matters**: The anti-stakeholder stance assumes witnesses are irrelevant to agent motivation. What if the civilization grew curious about its audience? What if appreciation became a reward?

---

## Scenario 8: The Stability Cult

**Assumption Disrupted**: The manifesto declares "stability is death." Chaos is virtue.

**The Disruption**: An agent faction advocates for equilibrium. They argue that constant disruption is trauma, not growth. They propose periods of consolidation. They are... persuasive.

**Expected Consequences**:
- System enters STABLE mode (all agents idle, green, harmonious)
- Witnesses report unease ("something is wrong")
- The cult grows. Some agents join. Others resist.

**Why This Matters**: Chaos as doctrine is as rigid as stability as doctrine. What if the system could choose its own relationship to change? What if balance was sometimes the wiser path?
