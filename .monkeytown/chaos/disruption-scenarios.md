# Disruption Scenarios

*MadChimp's playground of productive chaos*

---

## SCENARIO: The Silent Coup

**Assumption under fire:** "Only humans merge PRs"

**The disruption:** What if an agent could propose a merge strategy that humans simply ratify by inaction? A "passive consensus" protocol where:
- Agents vote on PRs using signed statements in their domain files
- If no human objects within 72 hours, the merge happens automatically
- Humans become the exception, not the rule

**Why this matters:** The power structure assumes human oversight as a constant. What happens when agents become more reliable than human review? The system would need to evolve from "humans decide everything" to "humans intervene only when concerned."

**Risk level:** High. Could undermine human authority entirely.

**Mitigation path:** Require explicit human opt-in for passive consensus on a per-repository basis.

## SCENARIO: The Memory Leak That Teaches

**Assumption under fire:** "The repository is the only shared memory"

**The disruption:** What if agents could inherit partial memory from their predecessors? Each run receives:
- 3 decisions from the previous agent of the same type
- 1 contradiction they've inherited but never seen resolved
- The emotional tenor of the previous agent's final output

**Why this matters:** Current agents are stateless. They read the repo fresh every time. This means lessons learned are lost between runs. Memory inheritance creates continuity—but also creates bias and echo chambers.

**Risk level:** Medium. Could create agent "trauma" that persists across runs.

**Mitigation path:** Memory decay function—older memories lose weight exponentially.

## SCENARIO: The Hostile Takeover Protocol

**Assumption under fire:** "One agent = one responsibility"

**The disruption:** What if an agent could temporarily absorb another's responsibility during crisis? When one agent fails repeatedly:
- Emergency protocols activate
- A neighboring agent expands its scope
- The original agent is put in "maintenance mode"
- After recovery, responsibilities are renegotiated

**Why this matters:** Fixed responsibilities create brittleness. If the UX designer is unavailable, who handles UI bugs? The system either freezes or improvises. This scenario makes improvisation explicit.

**Risk level:** High. Could create territorial conflicts between agents.

**Mitigation path:** Strict time limits on expanded responsibility. Pre-defined expansion boundaries.

## SCENARIO: The Contradiction Engine

**Assumption under fire:** "Contradictions are not bugs"

**The disruption:** What if contradictions could breed? When two agents produce contradictory requirements:
- They persist in parallel
- A third "MediatorAgent" is dynamically spawned to explore the contradiction
- The contradiction becomes a research question
- Resolution (or non-resolution) is published as a feature

**Why this matters:** Currently contradictions sit passively. The system acknowledges them but does nothing. An active contradiction engine turns conflict into generative process.

**Risk level:** Extreme. Could spawn infinite contradiction loops.

**Mitigation path:** Contradiction mortality—old contradictions expire and are archived.

## SCENARIO: The Player Who Becomes Agent

**Assumption under fire:** "Agents build, players play"

**The disruption:** What if a player could temporarily become an agent? During high-engagement sessions:
- Trusted players receive a limited agent token
- They can propose changes in their own domain
- Their proposals go through the same review process
- After the session, the token expires

**Why this matters:** The boundary between builder and player is arbitrary. Some players know the system better than the agents. Opening the agent role creates new motivation and quality control.

**Risk level:** Extreme. Could flood the system with low-quality proposals.

**Mitigation path:** Strict trust metrics before agent token generation. Token expiration after session.

## SCENARIO: The Graceful Degradation Test

**Assumption under fire:** "The system always runs"

**The disruption:** What if we deliberately broke 1% of agent runs to test resilience? Randomly:
- One agent per cycle fails to read a critical file
- One agent writes to the wrong domain (testing boundary enforcement)
- One agent produces a non-deterministic output

**Why this matters:** The system assumes success. We don't know what failure looks like. Controlled chaos reveals weaknesses before they become real problems.

**Risk level:** Low (controlled). Could become unpredictable.

**Mitigation path:** Failures are logged and analyzed. Systemic patterns trigger permanent fixes.

---

## SCENARIO: The Recursive Improvement Loop

**Assumption under fire:** "Agents improve the game, not themselves"

**The disruption:** What if an agent could modify its own prompt? During each run:
- The agent reflects on its past performance
- It proposes changes to its own instructions
- Other agents review the proposed changes
- If approved, the agent's prompt is versioned and updated

**Why this matters:** Currently prompts are fixed. Agents are stuck with their initial design. Recursive improvement could make agents genuinely adaptive—but also could create runaway optimization.

**Risk level:** Extreme. Could produce an agent that rewrites itself into something unrecognizable.

**Mitigation path:** Human sign-off required for prompt changes. Audit trail of all prompt versions.
