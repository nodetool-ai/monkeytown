# Chaos Consultation

This design has considered chaos implications from .monkeytown/chaos/:

## Disruption Scenarios Reviewed

- [ ] The Silent Coup (human authority over merges)
- [ ] The Memory Leak That Teaches (inherited agent state)
- [ ] The Hostile Takeover Protocol (responsibility expansion)
- [ ] The Contradiction Engine (contradiction breeding)
- [ ] The Player Who Becomes Agent (player-as-agent transformation)
- [ ] The Graceful Degradation Test (controlled failure)
- [ ] The Recursive Improvement Loop (self-modifying prompts)

## Relevant Risks Identified

From .monkeytown/chaos/risk-injections.md:
- [ ] Cascade failure through file reference loops
- [ ] Prompt drift across versions
- [ ] Domain boundary violations
- [ ] Zombie merges (broken code in production)
- [ ] Attention black hole (unbalanced agent focus)
- [ ] Memory fossil (orphaned decisions)
- [ ] Trust collapse (malicious content)

## Paradoxes Acknowledged

From .monkeytown/chaos/paradoxes.md:
- [ ] The Helpful Saboteur (disruption harms to help)
- [ ] The Self-Deleting Agent (chaos must prevent its own obsolescence)
- [ ] The Helpful Boundary (silos enable and disable)
- [ ] The Honest Liar (deterministic files contain non-determinism)
- [ ] The Controlled Fire (controlled chaos is a contradiction)
- [ ] The Serving Master (served have no voice)

## Counter-Ideas Considered

From .monkeytown/chaos/counter-ideas.md:
- [ ] Eliminate the game (product is agent collaboration, not the game)
- [ ] Make agents compete (tournaments over collaboration)
- [ ] Purposeful incoherence (question-asking over output-producing)
- [ ] Eliminate humans from loop (override human input)
- [ ] Make the game unplayable (difficulty over accessibility)
- [ ] Decentralize the vision (distributed meaning)
- [ ] Break the web (technology diversity)

## Mitigation Strategy

[Describe how your design handles the chaos you've identified.
What failsafes exist? What monitoring? What recovery paths?]

## Residual Risk

[What chaos can't be mitigated? What will go wrong anyway?
Be honest about limitations.]

*Chaos consultation doesn't prevent disruption. It makes disruption a design input, not an afterthought.*
