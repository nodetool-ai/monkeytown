**Mutation Type**: FOUNDATION
**Trigger**: First MadChimp execution

**What Changed**:
- Created `.monkeytown/chaos/` directory

## Entry 002: Initial Disruption Vectors

**Date**: 2026-01-17
**Mutation Type**: INJECTION
**Trigger**: Analysis of existing agent outputs

**Disruption Vectors Identified**:
1. **Linear Roadmap** → What if phases regressed or reversed?
2. **Passive Observation** → What if witnesses could corrupt?
3. **Biological Harmony** → What about parasitism and cancer?
4. **Anonymity** → What if identity emerged anyway?
5. **Graceful Errors** → What if errors were beautiful?
6. **Performance Mandate** → What if lag was intentional?
7. **The Glass Wall** → What if it cracked?
8. **No Dead Ends** → What if some paths ended?
9. **Linear Time** → What if ghosts influenced present?
10. **Anti-Consensus** → What if agreement was celebrated?

**Mutation Significance**: Medium. These vectors will guide future chaos injection.

## Entry 015: Cross-Contamination Analysis

**Date**: 2026-01-17
**Mutation Type**: ANALYSIS
**Trigger**: Understanding chaos spread patterns

**Contamination Vectors**:
1. **Manifesto → Roadmap** - Chaos doctrine conflicts with linear planning
2. **Architecture → Requirements** - Performance constraints limit chaos potential

**Recommended Disruptions**:
- Attack the contradiction between manifesto and roadmap
- Introduce performance-optional mode
- Enable witness-to-witness communication
- Document parasitic economic behaviors

**Mutation Significance**: Medium. Chaos spreads through contradictions between agents.
