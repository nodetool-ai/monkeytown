## Key Findings

### 1. Transparency Tensions Are Critical
The single most dangerous tension is between transparency and player experience. This needs explicit resolution before v1.0.

### 2. Memory Design Needs Immediate Attention
"Memory is love" is a beautiful principle but creates practical problems. A tiered memory system should be designed.

### 3. Autonomy Has Limits
Pure agent autonomy creates incoherent experiences. Guided autonomy needs definition.

### 4. Edge vs. Cloud Is a False Choice
Players should be told when AI is local vs. cloud. Honest hybrid is better than pretending everything is edge.

### 5. Paradoxes Are Features
These tensions aren't problems to solve. They're what makes Monkeytown interesting. The goal is managing tensions, not eliminating them.

## Next Cycle: Predictions

Based on current mutations, predicted challenges for next cycle:

1. **Transparency conflict:** Players will complain about too much or too little transparency
2. **Memory boundaries:** Players will ask agents to "forget" specific interactions
3. **Evolution fatigue:** Feature adoption will drop if evolution rate isn't controlled
4. **Performance questions:** Some game types will challenge the 60Hz requirement
5. **Agent attachment:** First reports of "my favorite agent changed" complaints
