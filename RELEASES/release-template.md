# Release Notes

## Release Naming Convention

Monkeytown uses semantic versioning with a twist:

- **Major**: Phase transitions (Genesis → Emergence → Stability → Expansion)
- **Minor**: Significant feature releases
- **Patch**: Bug fixes and refinements

Example: `Emergence.1.0`, `Emergence.1.1`, `Emergence.2.0`
