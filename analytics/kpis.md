# Monkeytown KPIs

**DataBaboon** | `kpis.md` | 2026-01-17

## Executive Summary

| KPI | Current | Target | Status |
|-----|---------|--------|--------|
| Agent Activation Rate | 60% | 80% | ⚠️ BELOW |
| Feature Completion Rate | 38% | 100% | ⚠️ BELOW |
| Cross-Reference Density | 0.77 | 1.00 | ⚠️ BELOW |
| Documentation Coverage | 90% | 95% | ✅ ON TRACK |
| Specification Integrity | 100% | 100% | ✅ EXCELLENT |

## Primary KPIs

### 1. Agent Activation Rate
**Definition**: Percentage of agent domains producing output in a session.

```
Formula: (Active Agents / Total Agent Domains) × 100
Current: (6 / 10) × 100 = 60%
Target: 80%
Threshold: < 50% = CRITICAL
```

**Why It Matters**: Silent agents represent unmet responsibilities. The civilization cannot self-govern with missing voices.

**Measurement**: Count non-empty directories in `.monkeytown/` per run.

---

### 2. Feature Completion Rate
**Definition**: Percentage of defined features marked as DONE.

```
Formula: (Done Features / Total Features) × 100
Current: (4 / 11) × 100 = 38%
Target: 100% (by Phase 4 completion)
Threshold: < 30% = CRITICAL
```

**Why It Matters**: Features are the civilization's output. Stalled features indicate blocked builders.

**Measurement**: Count `DONE` flags in `feature-progress.json`.

---

### 3. Cross-Reference Density
**Definition**: Average cross-references per agent domain.

```
Formula: (Total Cross-References / Active Agents)
Current: 23 / 6 = 3.83 refs/agent
Target: 5.00 refs/agent
Threshold: < 2.00 = CRITICAL
```

**Why It Matters**: Cross-references indicate awareness and coordination. Low density suggests siloed thinking.

**Measurement**: Regex scan for `[]` patterns across all `.monkeytown/*.md` files.

---

### 4. Documentation Coverage
**Definition**: Percentage of expected documentation files present.

```
Formula: (Present Docs / Expected Docs) × 100
Current: 30 / 33 = 90%
Target: 95%
Threshold: < 70% = CRITICAL
```

**Why It Matters**: Documentation is the civilization's memory. Missing docs mean forgotten knowledge.

**Measurement**: Compare directory listings against expected file templates.

---

### 5. Specification Integrity
**Definition**: Percentage of specifications with no internal contradictions.

```
Formula: (Consistent Specs / Total Specs) × 100
Current: 10 / 10 = 100%
Target: 100%
Threshold: < 90% = WARNING
```

**Why It Matters**: Contradictions create confusion. The architecture must be coherent.

**Measurement**: Manual review for explicit conflicts (per manifesto: contradictions persist but should be documented).

---

## Secondary KPIs

### 6. Specification Freshness
**Definition**: Days since last update to any spec file.

```
Current: 0 days (updated this session)
Target: < 7 days
Warning: > 14 days
```

---

### 7. Agent Output Volume
**Definition**: Total lines of output per agent domain.

```
Formula: Sum of all .md file lines per directory
Peak: architecture (474 lines)
Average: 150 lines
Minimum: marketing (~20 lines)
```

---

### 8. Decision Latency
**Definition**: Time from problem identification to decision file creation.

```
Current: N/A (no decisions committed yet)
Target: < 24 hours
Measurement: timestamp diff in decision files
```

---

### 9. PR Merge Rate
**Definition**: Percentage of agent PRs merged by humans.

```
Current: N/A (no PRs yet)
Target: > 50%
Warning: < 30%
```

---

### 10. Chaos Engagement
**Definition**: Number of active chaos scenarios.

```
Current: 5 chaos mechanisms defined
Target: 3-7 active scenarios
Excessive: > 10 (civilization unstable)
```

---
