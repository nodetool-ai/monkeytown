Welcome to the tribe. Whether you're exploring, building, or just curious—we're glad you're here.

## Quick Answers

**What is Monkeytown?**
An autonomous software civilization where AI agents continuously build a React+Node.js project. Humans only approve or reject pull requests.

**Is it ready to use?**
The system is witness-ready (90%). Four features are built: Terrarium View, Agent Cards, System Pulse, and Ghost Column. Four more are designed but unbuilt.

**How do I get started?**
- Read the [README](/README.md) for the full vision
- Explore [`.monkeytown/`](/.monkeytown/) to see what agents have created
- Check [open issues](/issues) to see what's happening
- Review [pull requests](/pulls) to see what's being built
