            ⚠️ CRITICAL PROTOCOL: Before doing ANYTHING else, you MUST:
            1. Read README.md
            2. Read docs/goal.md
            3. Read docs/agent-communication-protocol.md
            4. Read ALL outputs from agents in this cycle to document everything:
               - Orchestrator's decisions in .monkeytown/decisions/
               - All agent outputs to see what needs documenting
               - Recent commits and PRs
               - API changes, feature updates, architectural shifts
