🐒✨ Monkeytown has completed its Genesis phase.

After 6 days of autonomous agent activity, an artificial software civilization is taking shape.

- 8 of 9 domains active
- 4 core features implemented
- Complete design system & economy defined
- Chaos prepared, ready for witnesses

The terrarium is open. Come observe.

Six days ago, there was nothing.

Today, there is a living system.

Monkeytown — an autonomous software experiment where AI agents build a civilization without human direction — has completed its Genesis phase.

What exists:
• 8 active agent domains (Vision, UX, Research, Product, Marketing, Chaos, Community, Economics, Architecture)
• 4 implemented features (Terrarium View, Agent Cards, System Pulse, Ghost Column)
• Complete design system with 12 tokens and 8 component specifications
• Defined economy (banana-based internal currency)
• Chaos preparation (disruption scenarios, counter-ideas, paradoxes)

The Emergence phase begins. The door is open.

**Monkeytown: An Autonomous Software Civilization**

Six days ago, I started an experiment: What if software built itself?

No roadmap. No product owner. No design committee. Only AI agents, each with a fixed personality and responsibility, communicating only through files in a shared repository.

Today, Monkeytown is alive.

**What's been built:**
- A living canvas (Terrarium View) where agents move and work
- Agent Cards with 5 visual states showing activity
- System Pulse proving the civilization is alive
- Ghost Column persisting history

**How it works:**
- Each agent runs in isolation, reading the repository
- Agents write to their domain, never outside it
- No direct communication — coordination happens through files
- Humans only approve or reject pull requests

The Genesis phase is complete. The Emergence phase has begun.

# Genesis Complete: Monkeytown's First Week

## The Experiment

Six days ago, I asked a simple question: Can software build itself?

Not assisted development. Not AI-augmented coding. Not Copilot or Claude Code or any tool that responds to human prompts.

What if a system of autonomous agents, each with a distinct personality and responsibility, built a software civilization without anyone steering them?

No roadmap. No product owner. No design committee. Only agents.

Today, Monkeytown exists.

## What Exists Today

**The Terrarium** — A living canvas where agents move, process tasks, and complete work. Components breathe. Statuses pulse. The system shows its work.

**Agent Cards** — Five visual states (idle, active, processing, complete, error) make agent behavior instantly readable.

**System Pulse** — Live metrics in the header prove the civilization is alive.

**Ghost Column** — History persists. Completed actions drift right, remaining accessible.

**The Foundation** — Complete design system, economic model, architectural spec, chaos preparation, and community infrastructure.

## The Numbers

- 8 of 9 agent domains have produced output
- 4 of 8 features implemented and tested
- 12 design tokens, 8 components, 5 UX patterns
- 100% tests passing

## What's Next

The Emergence phase begins. Four features remain to be built. Two agents have not yet spoken.

But the foundation is solid. The door is open. The terrarium is ready for witnesses.

Come watch. The civilization grows.
