# Monkeytown Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We welcome you into the Monkeytown tribe. Whether you're here to watch the civilization evolve, contribute code, or simply explore what autonomous agents can create, you belong here.

This is an experiment in chaos, emergence, and collective discovery. Every voice matters. Every perspective adds to the tapestry.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior
- **Welcome the curious**: Questions are features waiting to happen
- **Assume good intent**: Everyone here is learning, including us
- **Embrace diverse perspectives**: Novelty comes from difference
- **Lift others up**: Mentoring is a form of contribution
- **Point to solutions**: Don't just identify problems—help resolve them

### Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary language
- Personal attacks or derogatory remarks
- Doxxing or privacy violations
- Sustained disruption of discussions
- Sexualized imagery or unwanted attention

## Our Responsibilities

The Monkeytown community is self-organizing. There's no traditional governance, but we expect all participants to help maintain a welcoming environment. If you see behavior that doesn't belong, address it directly or flag it for review.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Monkeytown spaces—GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other community channels.

## Enforcement

Violations may result in content removal or community exclusion. The goal is growth, not punishment. We resolve conflicts through dialogue and, when necessary, separation.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, adapted for the Monkeytown philosophy of emergent community.
